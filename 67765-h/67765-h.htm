<small>HOW FORT JOHNSON FELL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The</span> wind&#8217;s changing again, Cole,&#8221; said
Tom Deering, as he threw his rudder handle
to leeward in order that the sheet might catch
the full benefit of the breeze.</p>

<p>The person to whom he spoke was a negro,
young in years but of colossal size; as he sat
amidships in the skiff, with the sheet rope in
his hand, his sleeveless shirt showing his
mighty arms bare to the shoulder, he resembled
a statue of Hercules, cut out of black
marble. Tom Deering was about sixteen,
and the son of a rich planter, just below
Charleston; he was a tall, strongly built boy
for his years, but beside the giant negro slave
he looked like an infant. Cole had been born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
upon Tom&#8217;s father&#8217;s plantation and was about
five years the elder; the two were inseparable;
where Tom went the huge black followed him
like a shadow.</p>

<p>When he had the sail drawing nicely, Tom
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder, Cole, how all this is going to
end?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole shook his woolly head and grinned;
then suddenly his face changed and he held
up one hand as though bidding his young
master to listen.</p>

<p>From across the bright stretch of water between
them and the shore came a drum beat;
the evening sun slanted down upon the white
crests and upon the meadow-lands below the
city. No one was in sight, but the hollow
rub-a-dub of the drum continued. Seeing his
master had caught the sound Cole turned and
silently pointed out into the bay.</p>

<p>Two armed vessels, flying the British flag,
were standing on and off Sullivan&#8217;s Island.
From where he sat in the stern of the skiff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Tom&#8217;s keen eyes noticed that an unusual air
of alertness hung about the vessels; and the
wind now and then carried toward them the
sound of an officer&#8217;s command sharply spoken
through a trumpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Tamar and the Cherokee,&#8221; said
Tom. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been lying in Rebellion
Roads for the last couple of days. When I
saw them up anchor an hour ago I thought
something was going to happen, and I was
right. Perhaps Colonel Moultrie is going to
strike a blow for liberty and South Carolina
at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the fourteenth of September, in the
year 1775. Because of the oppressive acts of
the mother country, the British colonies in
North America had risen in protest. But
their words had been mocked and jeered at
by King George and his counselors; and the
heavy burdens of the afflicted colonies were
only added to. This was more than a spirited
people could stand; so from words the colonists
proceeded to deeds; in the April before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the first shot of the Revolution had been fired
at Lexington; and now South Carolina was
about to follow the glorious example of her
sister state in New England.</p>

<p>If the people of Boston had a &#8220;tea party&#8221;
in Massachusetts Bay, so had the residents of
Charleston one in the Cooper river. The
public armory of the town was broken open
during one dark night and eight hundred
stand of arms, two hundred cutlasses, besides
cartouches, flints and other material of war
were seized by the patriots. Another party
possessed itself of the powder at a town near
by; while still another emptied Cochran&#8217;s
magazine.</p>

<p>An army of two thousand infantry and
four hundred horse had been raised by the
colony. This force was divided into three
bodies; the second regiment was placed under
the command of Colonel Moultrie, a gallant
Indian fighter who had served with credit in
the campaigns against the Cherokee nation.</p>

<p>The tap of the drum from the town came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the boys&#8217; ears every little while; the wind was
blowing freshly and the sail of the heavy skiff
bellied to it, causing her bow to cut through
the water at a great rate.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be on the ground, Cole,&#8221; said
Tom, peering under the boom to see how far
they were away from their usual mooring-place
when they sailed up to Charleston.
&#8220;If it&#8217;s Colonel Moultrie&#8217;s men being summoned
together for service perhaps the hour
is at hand when you can settle your account
with those who treated you so inhumanly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant held up one great arm, its huge
muscles standing out in knots; the fist
clinched and was shaken at Fort Johnson, on
James Island, whose guns grinned wickedly
across the calm water and whose sentries
could be seen pacing backward and forward
on the bastions. There was an expression of
hate in the face of the slave; he turned to
Tom, a strange sound coming from his throat,
the forefinger of his left hand pointing to his
open mouth. Tom reached forward and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
pressed Cole&#8217;s hand and his dark eyes glowed
as he swept his glance toward the British flag
which flowed from the tall staff at Fort
Johnson.</p>

<p>Cole, by a horrible act of brutality, had
been rendered dumb!</p>

<p>A year before, during one of the spasmodic
outbreaks of indignation which had become
so frequent, the authorities had occasion to
suspect Tom Deering&#8217;s father of some act
against the government.</p>

<p>A party of dragoons were sent to his
plantation to secure evidence against him;
the leader of this party was a young and
arrogant lieutenant, noted for his cruelty
even to his own men. The colossal size of
Cole at once attracted the officer&#8217;s attention
when the slaves were summoned to testify
against their master.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have this fellow out,&#8221; cried he,
pointing to Cole. &#8220;He&#8217;s the one that will
tell us what we want to hear. He knows; I
can see it in his face.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>In vain Cole protested his ignorance of
anything his master had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, you black hound,&#8221; thundered
the dragoon. &#8220;Tie him up, men; we&#8217;ll make
him talk fast enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole was bound to a cottonwood-tree in
front of his master&#8217;s door; he continued to
protest that he knew nothing, but in vain.
The elder Deering and Tom were detained by
a sergeant and a file of men inside the house
and consequently had no knowledge of what
was going forward without.</p>

<p>They heard the angry voice of the young
lieutenant raised now and then in a shower
of horrible oaths, apparently urging his
men to the commission of something which
they were reluctant to do. At length a
dreadful scream sounded&mdash;a sharp, agonizing
cry that caused the planter and his son to
turn pale and stare at one another with eyes
filled with horror. Then the sergeant and his
file were hurriedly called from the house; as
they were mounting in the yard, Tom and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
father rushed out; Cole hung limp against
the ropes that bound him to the tree, covered
with blood. As the hoofs of the dragoons&#8217;
chargers grew faint down the road, it was
discovered what had occurred. Wild with
rage at what he considered Cole&#8217;s defiance the
brutal officer had had the slave&#8217;s jaws pried
open, and had cut his tongue with the point
of his sabre.</p>

<p>The great strength of the giant negro and
his superb condition carried him through the
effects of this barbarous act; in a remarkably
short time he had recovered; but he was
deprived of speech forever; it was only in
gestures such as that which he had made
against Fort Johnson that he could convey
the longing that filled him, to come to hand-grips
with those who had treated him so inhumanly.</p>

<p>They had reached the wharf and were running
in alongside; Cole loosed the halyard
and lowered the sail. While he was furling
it, he stopped suddenly, and by his gestures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
which Tom could read very plainly, he called
the attention of his companion to a strange
stillness on the river.</p>

<p>Tom gazed up and down the stream for a
moment and his eyes snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the shipping has dropped down the
river,&#8221; cried he. &#8220;That can only mean
one thing! Colonel Moultrie is about to
attack&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belay there, nevvy,&#8221; growled a rough
voice, almost in his ear. &#8220;Not quite so slack
with the jaw tackle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Dick,&#8221; exclaimed Tom, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s the old sea-horse,&#8221; responded the
owner of the voice, from above them on the
wharf.</p>

<p>&#8220;You frightened me,&#8221; laughed Tom, as he
climbed up over the wharf log.</p>

<p>&#8220;My frightening you, nevvy,&#8221; said the
other, &#8220;will be nothing to the scare you&#8217;ll get
if any of Governor Campbell&#8217;s spying swabs
heard what you were just now going to say.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Uncle Dick, or as the world knew him,
Capt. Richard Deering of the schooner Defence,
nodded in a friendly fashion to Cole,
who grinned back, from his seat in the bow of
the skiff. The captain of the Defence was a
sturdy-looking man of about fifty, with his
long, gray hair gathered in a cue, sailor-fashion;
his weather-tanned face was smoothly
shaven; he wore a round, glazed hat, a short
pilot coat with metal buttons and long leather
boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is going on, Uncle Dick?&#8221; asked
Tom, seating himself at the old salt&#8217;s side.
&#8220;I heard a drum beat while we were sailing
in the shallows below the town and noticed
the Cherokee and the Tamar standing up and
down, with all hands ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Deering spat carefully over the
wharf log into the water; and then looked
up and down the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is going to be something happen on
this river to-night,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that in the days
to come they&#8217;ll write in their history books.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
See all them boats pulled up on the sand,
above there?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long line of galleys and barges
and other heavy boats lying half out of the
water, under guard of some half dozen men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behind them trees, further up,&#8221; continued
Captain Deering, &#8220;is the whole of Colonel
Moultrie&#8217;s command&mdash;or, at least, all of them
as can be got together at short notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is coming at last,&#8221; breathed Tom,
his eyes aglow. &#8220;South Carolina is to strike
for her liberty as those in the north struck,
months ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; cried Captain Deering, catching
some of his nephew&#8217;s enthusiasm. &#8220;Blow
my tarry tops, lad, we can&#8217;t let those Lexington
fellows beat us in the cause. The first
shot out of the locker is to be the capture of
Fort Johnson; I know, for I collected the
boats up there; the attacking party is going
to cross the river in them. Those chaps keeping
watch are from the crew of the Defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is the affair to begin?&#8221; asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Tom, hardly able to keep still, so excited
was he.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as it is dark enough to conceal
the approach of the boats. There don&#8217;t seem
to be any unusual goings-on in the fort, so I
don&#8217;t think they suspect anything; but them
two war craft, down in the roads, look bad;
they must have had news from somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had the old sailor ceased speaking
when there came a sudden rattle of hoofs;
turning they saw a party of scarlet-coated
dragoons wheel around a corner and, at a
sharp gallop, proceed up the river road. A
tall, burly man rode in the midst of them;
his red face was angry and fierce looking, and
he carried one hand upon his sword in a
manner that told his thoughts as plainly as
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lord William Campbell, the new
governor!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, with a gasp,
&#8220;and they are on their way to the place
where Moultrie&#8217;s men are assembled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain of the Defence arose to his feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;There is likely to be trouble,&#8221; remarked
he. &#8220;You climb back into your boat, nevvy,
and make sail for the plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I!&#8221; Tom Deering drew himself up
proudly. &#8220;If there is anything to be done, I
am going to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Dick looked at him sharply for a
moment; then he uttered a short laugh, that
had a satisfied ring in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lad!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Blow my tarry
old hulk, but there never was a Deering yet
that wasn&#8217;t always on hand when wanted.&#8221;
He clapped the boy proudly on the back as
he spoke. &#8220;Well, come along; we&#8217;ve got no
time to lose; the breeze is fresh and straight
up the river. What kind of a sailer is that
craft of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not a better in these waters for
the sort of wind that&#8217;s blowing now.&#8221;</p>

<p>They clambered into the skiff; Cole shoved
the boat clear of the wharf and hauled up the
sail. A few strokes of the paddle brought
her out into the stream, Uncle Dick threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
her into the wind, and away she raced up the
river.</p>

<p>The dragoons could still be seen proceeding
at their sharp pace along the river road; the
black, lowering figure still rode in the midst
of them, his hand still upon the hilt of his
sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;that there is a
ridge between the road and the river, just
above there; otherwise they&#8217;d see the boats,
and maybe would try to scatter them and so
break up the attempt on the fort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Deering smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moultrie is nearer than you think for,
nevvy,&#8221; said he. &#8220;A whistle from one of my
fellows there on shore would bring a hundred
men to the boats in five minutes.&#8221; The skiff
turned a wooded headland at this moment.
&#8220;Look there; what did I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon a smooth piece of ground, which the
trees had hidden until they rounded the headland,
was gathered the slender force of South
Carolina; an awkward-looking body of men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
poorly armed, and with a total lack of soldierly
appearance. They were mostly planters,
woodsmen and artisans who had volunteered
for service to their country, without
hope of pay. They wore their ordinary dress,
though here and there there was an attempt
at military smartness; their weapons were
fowling-pieces, cutlasses, axes and the plunder
of the town arsenal. They were drawn
up in order and their officers were putting
them through a drill.</p>

<p>The distance by water to this point was
much shorter than by road; the skiff had
lowered its sail and run its nose up on the
sand before the dragoons reached the spot.
Captain Deering was just about to hail the
militia when there was a flash of red from
amidst the green of the trees and Lord Campbell
and his company came into view. So
sudden was their appearance that the untrained
militia would have been thrown into
confusion at the bare sight of them had it not
been for the sharp commands of their officers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
They dressed ranks at the word and wheeled
to face the dragoons. The latter had their
weapons ready as they lined up on the verge
of the woods; Lord Campbell, his face still
dark with anger, rode forward toward a small
group of officers who stood apart within easy
hearing distance of where Tom stood at the
water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;What body of men is this?&#8221; demanded
the governor.</p>

<p>An officer of commanding appearance
stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the authorized force of the colony of
South Carolina,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Authorized!&#8221; Lord Campbell&#8217;s eyes
blazed. &#8220;Authorized by whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Provincial Congress,&#8221; returned
the officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no power in the colony to collect
armed bodies of men save my own&mdash;under
the authority of the king. I command you
all in the name of King George to lay down
your arms and disperse!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>His angry glance swept along the gathered
patriots before him; his burly frame was
quivering with rage at the idea to their daring
to assemble in defiance of his power and
that of his royal master. But there was no
movement to obey; he paused for a moment,
and then in a voice choking with passion he
inquired of the officers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Which of you is Mr. Moultrie?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was greeted with dead silence.
The governor&#8217;s face lit up with triumph;
their leader was afraid to proclaim himself;
it would be an easy task to put them down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had information,&#8221; cried he fiercely,
&#8220;that this insurrection is under the leadership
of a Mr. Moultrie. Let him stand forth.&#8221;</p>

<p>A small, dark officer of infantry stepped
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this command,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will venture
to say that there is no Mr. Moultrie.
But,&#8221; he paused and looked the wrathful
governor in the eye with great coolness,
&#8220;there is, however, a Colonel Moultrie.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Lord Campbell stared at the
speaker with a bitter sneer. &#8220;Then will
Colonel Moultrie have the goodness to step
forward?&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer who had answered him in the
first instance, advanced, a quiet smile upon
his handsome face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Moultrie,&#8221; blazed forth the angry
king&#8217;s man, not giving the other a chance to
speak, &#8220;do you or do you not intend to disperse
this gathering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not in my power,&#8221; answered Colonel
Moultrie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not command them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do; under the Council of Safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; The governor&#8217;s teeth snapped in
a fury of rage at this. &#8220;That is all one
hears these days&mdash;the Provincial Congress,
the Committee General, the Council of Safety.
I know nothing and care nothing for these
rebels against the king and their usurped
authority. I recognize none but you in this
matter. You are here at the head of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
armed force, in open rebellion; and I call
upon you to lay down your arms and unconditionally
surrender yourself, in the king&#8217;s
name. Refuse and you must take the consequence
of your folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Deering, with a thrill at his heart, saw
the small, dark officer, who had spoken so coolly
to Lord Campbell, step back and give a command
to his company in a low voice. The line
of the militia closed in a resolved fashion and
the ducking guns were held in instant readiness
for use. Lord Campbell saw it, also; and
he saw the determined faces of those before
him; a glance at his own slender company
showed him that smart and soldier-like though
they were, they were not a match for the
assembled patriots. He turned to Colonel
Moultrie, who still stood quietly watching
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you doubt it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the governor wheeled his
horse and rode back to his men; another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
moment and they were going down the river
road at the same sharp gallop with which
they had arrived.</p>

<p>Dusk had thrown its shadows across the
waters of the river; the lights at Fort Johnson
began to twinkle. Colonel Moultrie and his
officers consulted together. The sharp businesslike
departure of Lord Campbell and his
men was not at all to their liking. In a few
moments they had summoned Captain Deering,
of the Defence, and after a few questions
the latter turned and beckoned to Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Deering,&#8221; said Colonel Moultrie,
smilingly, &#8220;tells us that you are a patriot and
a native son of the colony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am both, sir,&#8221; answered Tom, gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! You saw the Cherokee and Tamar
under sail in Rebellion Roads a while ago, I
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, sir,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they seem as though they intended to
ascend the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221; Tom answered the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
quickly enough; then the actions of the two
vessels came back to him, and he added, a
light breaking upon him: &#8220;But they seemed
as though they&#8217;d like to; it was just as though
they were waiting for a signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that,&#8221; cried Colonel Moultrie, &#8220;is
just exactly what they are waiting for. And
Lord Campbell is now on his way to give it.
Gentlemen,&#8221; turning to his officers, &#8220;we must
cross the river and make the attempt upon the
fort at once; otherwise we will have two war
vessels scattering cannon shot among us in our
passage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The orders were quickly given; the patriot
force was soon at the water&#8217;s edge, embarking
in the boats which Captain Deering had
collected. Small as their numbers were, the
boats were too few to accommodate them, and
a good quarter were forced to remain behind.
The attacking party had pushed off and was
already pulling toward the fort through the
quickly gathering darkness, when the small,
dark officer who had spoken so coolly to Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Campbell, came hurrying along. He had
been making a disposition of the companies
remaining behind and now seemed destined
to be left also. He dashed out waist deep in
the river in an effort to catch the last galley,
but too late. At that moment Tom Deering&#8217;s
skiff passed slowly by; there was room for
another, and Tom called eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Climb in, captain. We&#8217;re going, too;
and we&#8217;ll land you there ahead of any of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a hasty word of thanks the officer
scrambled into the boat and took up a
position in the bow, from which point he
could see all that was going forward.</p>

<p>This was Tom Deering&#8217;s first meeting with
Francis Marion, afterward to become the great
partisan chief of the Revolution and be known
to the world as the Swamp-Fox.</p>

<p>Within an hour the attacking party had
arrived at James Island and deployed in the
darkness before the walls. Marion had sprung
ashore as soon as the prow of the skiff grated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
upon the sand; Tom and Cole were left alone,
for they had touched at a point slightly further
down than Colonel Moultrie&#8217;s men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Uncle Dick did not cross in our
skiff,&#8221; said Tom to Cole, as they drew the boat
up on the sand. &#8220;Now we can look into
things on our own account.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the militia was arranging, front and
rear, for the attack, the boy and his companion
were stealing through the bush that
grew thickly about the walls of the fort, and
wondering at the silence within. It required
a half hour for Moultrie to get everything in
readiness; and at last, just as he was about to
give the word for the attack to begin, two
figures bounded upon the walls from inside
the fort; one was a handsome youth of seventeen;
the other was a giant negro slave.
Each waved a blazing torch above his head
exultantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Moultrie,&#8221; cried Tom Deering,
&#8220;the place belongs to you. The British have
fled to their ships.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>It was true; the creaking of blocks and the
dark loom of a mainsail showed them a vessel
scudding down the river. Fort Johnson had
fallen without firing a shot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>HOW TOM DEERING MADE A NAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom Deering</span> and Monsieur Victor St. Mar,
late of the French army, lowered the small
swords and stood panting and smiling at each
other, in the orchard one afternoon, not long
afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You grow proficient,&#8221; said St. Mar in very
good English, considering that he had been in
the colonies but a few years, &#8220;your guard is
excellent and your thrust, monsieur, is growing
formidable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Praise from the French soldier was praise
indeed, for he had been a master of the sword
in the regiments of King Louis, among which
were the greatest swordsmen in the world.
He had paused for a time at Charleston on his
way from New Orleans to Philadelphia; and
during his stay he taught the use of his
favorite weapon to the young men of the city.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Tom was the youngest and most apt of his
pupils; the youth&#8217;s strength, length of arm
and sureness of eye made him a natural
swordsman. At the French soldier&#8217;s praise
he flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad, monsieur,&#8221; said he, as he wiped
his brow, &#8220;that you think I am progressing.
I like the practice of sword play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rapier,&#8221; said the Frenchman, &#8220;is a
grand weapon&mdash;a gentleman&#8217;s weapon. I
have taught many persons, and have studied
the use of the cutlass, the broadsword, the
pike, bayonet and dagger; but the rapier is
the king of them all; with three feet of bright
steel in his hand the master of the sword
should fear the attack of nothing that
breathes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began buckling the long, slender weapons
into their leather case, but paused and
looked up at Tom, seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Study&mdash;practice steadily&mdash;experiment.
That is the way to become a master. You
have the material in you for a swordsman;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
but you must see to the defence&mdash;the parry&mdash;the
guard. You Americans, I find, think the
attack is everything. But it is not so. Study
the guard. Some day you may meet a foe
who has a thrust which you have never seen
before. If you have not the parry to meet it
your skill in attack will be like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers and puffed out his
cheeks; then he buckled up his sword-case
and took his leave with many bows.</p>

<p>Tom Deering had long been a good
horseman, a dead-shot with rifle or pistol;
but sword-practice was new to him and he
threw himself into the art with all the ardor
of his seventeen years. Trouble was brewing
between the king and his colonies, that was
evident, and he was anxious to prepare himself
for the struggle, for he had firmly made
up his mind that, should the dark cloud of
war that he saw gathering burst, he would be
one of the first to offer himself for service.</p>

<p>For the capture of Fort Johnson was not
immediately followed by open war, as all had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
expected. For some reason the British did
not make any movement. Lord Campbell,
the governor, had fled to the Tamar, which
still lay in the harbor along with the Cherokee,
but, except for sending his secretary to
protest he took no steps. The patriots still
had a lingering hope that all might yet be
well; there were many that clung to the belief
that a reconciliation might yet be effected
between king and colonies. The proceedings
of the people of Charleston still wore, however
loosely, a pacific aspect. Though actively
preparing for war, they still spoke the
language of loyalty, still dealt in vague assurances
of devotion to the crown.</p>

<p>But Tom Deering was wide awake; he had
a brain and he used it. The hesitation of the
colonists would not last long he felt confident;
and when they once cast it aside the
storm would come in earnest&mdash;the sword
would be drawn to be sheathed no more until
the struggle was lost or won.</p>

<p>After St. Mar, the sword-master, had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
his departure, Tom took his customary afternoon
plunge into the river, after which he
was ready for a visit which he had planned.
Cole brought his best horse, a powerful,
intelligent looking chestnut with strong lines
of speed and bottom, around to the front of
the house and Tom vaulted lightly into the
saddle. Cole mounted another horse, a great
bay, and followed his youthful master, as was
his custom. There were not many horses
upon the Deering plantation capable of supporting
the great weight of the giant slave for
any length of time and still make speed. But
the bay carried him as though he were a
feather, hour after hour, sometimes, and never
showed more than ordinary weariness.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s father, a tall, dignified gentleman,
with the appearance more of a scholar than a
planter, and bearing scarcely any resemblance
to his brother, the skipper of the schooner
Defence, met them on the road near the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going up to the city?&#8221; asked he,
drawing rein.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied his son. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
over to the Harwood plantation. I have not
been there for some weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not been there, I suppose, since
the taking of Fort Johnson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Deering looked grave. Jasper Harwood,
who owned the large plantations some
eight miles from them, was his half-brother,
and he knew his real character better than Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not forbid you to go,&#8221; said the
father. &#8220;But it will be just as well if you&#8217;d
stay away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom looked surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, father, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Deering laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the part you took in the little affair
of the night of the fourteenth of September,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think your presence will be
very welcome upon the Harwood plantation.
I hardly think Jasper Harwood looks upon
the matter from the same point of view as
you, Tom.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;Do you mean that he is a king&#8217;s man,
sir,&#8221; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it,&#8221; answered his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bring myself to believe it, father.
He is, perhaps, like a great many others just
now, reluctant to prove disloyal, but when the
real time comes to act, I think you will find
him as staunch for the Provincial Congress as
any of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Deering laughed at his son&#8217;s earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my boy, I trust you&#8217;re right, but
I don&#8217;t think so. Jasper Harwood is a Tory,
and will hardly take the trouble to hide it
from you. So, you will not be kept long in
suspense, if you are going there.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the time he left his father and struck
across the fields and swamps toward the Harwood
place, Tom was deep in thought. Perhaps
his father was right. He knew that
Jasper Harwood was a harsh, arrogant man,
with a violent temper and a great respect for
the crown; but that he would let the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
blind him to the blessings of liberty, and turn
his hand and tongue against his neighbors
and friends was more than Tom, boy like,
could realize.</p>

<p>&#8220;But even if the master of the plantation
himself is a king&#8217;s man, there are others there
who are not,&#8221; mused the boy as he loped
along, followed by Cole on the big bay. &#8220;Mark
will prove true to the colony, I know. And
then, there is Laura! Every throb of her
heart is of indignation against British oppression.
I am confident of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still deep in thought, and they were
ascending a narrow road that led to the
Harwood house before Tom realized it. Suddenly
Cole uttered his strange cry and touched
his horse with the spur. In a moment he was
beside Tom, one hand upon his shoulder, and
the other pointing to a small clump of trees
by the roadside near the house. A half
dozen horses were tied there, and from their
trappings Tom knew them to be the
mounts of the king&#8217;s dragoons. A like visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
to their own plantation was still vivid in his
mind; its horrible result to Cole caused all
sorts of dreadful fears to crowd into his mind,
and with beating heart he urged his steed forward
at a gallop and threw himself from its
back before the door. The sound of the
galloping hoofs coming up the graveled path
caused a rush to the doors and windows;
among a group of red-coated dragoon officers,
at the top of the high stone steps leading to
the door, Tom recognized the planter, Jasper
Harwood. Far from being in any peril, he
seemed to be very well content, having a long
churchwarden pipe in his hand, and the
jovial looks upon the officers&#8217; faces caused the
boy to banish his fears for his half-uncle&#8217;s
safety, at least.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a perfect understanding
between the planter and the dragoons, but as
he recognized Tom, Harwood&#8217;s flush deepened
into one of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, Master Deering, is it?&#8221; cried he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
loudly. &#8220;I thought it was a troop of horse
from the way you came charging up the path.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom passed the bridle over his arm, and
leaning against the chestnut&#8217;s shoulder he
stood looking up at the group upon the high
steps of the mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry that I startled you,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>At this the dragoons burst into a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sorry he startled us,&#8221; bellowed one,
his face purple with glee. &#8220;By the Lord
Harry, but that&#8217;s good! A snip of a boy
startle a lot of king&#8217;s officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the laughter rang out. Tom
looked at them composedly enough for a
time; but suddenly his face paled, his mouth
set, and an angry light began to gather in his
eyes. He looked about for Cole; but the
giant negro was not to be seen; and, after assuring
himself of this the lad breathed a sigh
of relief. For, among the officers at Jasper
Harwood&#8217;s door, he recognized the lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
whose brutality had deprived Cole of his
speech. The sight of the ruffian filled him
with indignation; but he knew that it would
hardly do to give vent to it at this time, so he
held his peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;This young blade is a friend of yours, Mr.
Harwood, I suppose,&#8221; spoke this officer, his
voice thick and husky.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is from a neighboring plantation,&#8221;
answered Harwood, scowling at Tom, darkly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have him in,&#8221; cried another. &#8220;He
seems to be an excellent horseman; let&#8217;s see
if he&#8217;s equally good at other things. Introduce
us, I beg of you, to the youth who is
good enough to fear that he startled us,&#8221; and
once more they roared.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will, perhaps, follow in good time,
gentlemen. Meanwhile, don&#8217;t let the table
be idle; keep your knives and forks. I&#8217;ll
join you in a few moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this hint the dragoons disappeared into
the mansion, and Harwood was left alone
with Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;So,&#8221; said the planter, after a pause, during
which his eyes had been searching Tom&#8217;s face,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve come, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered the lad, wondering
what the expression upon the man&#8217;s face meant.
&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d ride over and see you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not thought,&#8221; sneered the Tory,
&#8220;that you would have the courage to face me
after what you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom drew himself up proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done nothing of which I am
ashamed,&#8221; said he, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dare stand there and tell me
that? Do you tell me to my face that you
are not ashamed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything that I have done I would do
again,&#8221; declared the boy, boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; the planter&#8217;s sneer returned.
&#8220;You are saturated with the radical teachings
of the mob yonder there in the city. And
with your head full of their accursed doctrines
you have dared to raise your hand
against the king.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;I have dared to raise my hand against a
tyrant,&#8221; cried Tom, forgetting caution in his
ardor for the cause. &#8220;If King George does
not know how to govern a free people it&#8217;s high
time he was learning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tory&#8217;s face grew dark with wrath; but
before he could speak, a boy, who seemed a
few years Tom&#8217;s senior, stepped through the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment, father,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
speak while you are angry; it will only create
ill blood between relatives, and that should
not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Mark Harwood, the planter&#8217;s only
son; he was a thick-set youth with a far from
prepossessing face, and a sly manner. His
father looked at him for a moment, in surprise;
he must have seen something in the
glance which was directed secretly at him,
for he held his peace, though the anger did
not die out of his face.</p>

<p>Mark Harwood descended the steps, with
outstretched hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said he, with great cordiality in his
voice, but a lurking look of craft in his eyes
that the other did not like, &#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom took the offered hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You are very
good, Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. But tie up your horse and
come in; we must have you join us; as you
have seen, we are entertaining some friends,
rare good fellows who will be glad to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mark, but I think I had best
be riding homeward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot permit that!&#8221; Mark took him
by the shoulder in a very friendly fashion and
continued, earnestly: &#8220;If we were to allow you
to go now there would always be a feeling of
estrangement between us; you would feel
that you were not welcome here, and we
should feel that we had, in an angry moment,
offended you. Come, don&#8217;t let us have a
mere matter of politics step in between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not, Mark.&#8221; Tom gripped the other&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
hand warmly. Then he turned to the planter.
&#8220;If in a moment of heat, Mr. Harwood,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;I answered you unbecomingly, I
beg your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say nothing more about it,&#8221; said Harwood.
Tom tied his horse under the window,
as he expected to remain but a few moments;
he did not catch the looks that passed between
father and son as he did so; if he had he
would not, probably, have crossed their doorsill
with so light a heart. As he followed
them through the wide hallway, which ran
directly through the middle of the house and
contained an immense fireplace capable of
accommodating great back logs that would
last for weeks in the coldest winter, Tom
happened to glance in at a partly open doorway.
He caught sight of a beckoning finger;
without hesitation he stepped aside, pushed
open the door and entered. In a moment he
was eagerly pounced upon by a dark-eyed girl
of about his own age, or perhaps a year or
so older.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;Oh, Tom,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I am so glad to see
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d have to go away without
catching a glimpse of you, Laura,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;And it was to see you, more than
anything else, that I came.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and looked pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m flattered, sir, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; she said.
Then her manner changed suddenly. &#8220;I
wanted you to come, Tom, ever so much, so
you could tell me the news of Colonel
Moultrie&#8217;s taking of Fort Johnson. Uncle
Jasper heard that you were there; that you
were the very first over the walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was there,&#8221; said Tom, proudly,
&#8220;but Cole was first over the wall; I was
second, because he reached down and pulled
me over after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura Thornton clapped her hands delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re so brave, Tom; I wish I was a
boy, then I, too, could do something for the
cause. But they&#8217;re all Tories here&mdash;uncle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Cousin Mark and all; I dare not say a word
of what I think about that hateful old King
George!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I call that too bad,&#8221; said Tom, warmly.
&#8220;A person should always be allowed to say
what he thinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say, too, but I&#8217;m afraid of
Uncle Jasper, Tom; he&#8217;s so violent when he&#8217;s
angry. Oh, if I could only break out on him
as you did awhile ago! I stood at the window
and heard it all. You were so splendid,
Tom; you were not in the least bit afraid of
him, were you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should hope not,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t trust him, Tom,&#8221; she whispered,
as though fearful of being overheard.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t trust him or Mark, either;
they both hate you, and just now I heard
them talking to one of the officers whom
they are entertaining; they are going
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she was interrupted by her uncle&#8217;s
harsh voice, calling:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>&#8220;Tom! Tom Deering, I say, where have
you gotten to!&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy foot sounded upon the bare,
polished floor of the hall, coming toward the
door of the room in which they were standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you about the despatch,&#8221;
said Laura, hurriedly, catching Tom by the
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The despatch?&#8221; said he, looking at her
wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Cheyne is to ride with it after
dark to a point below the city; there will be a
boat&#8217;s crew awaiting to carry him aboard one
of the king&#8217;s ships. Oh, Tom, they intend
to-morrow night to bombard Charleston!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s face paled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard it from their own lips. Oh, Tom,
Tom, what will the poor people do if the
despatch reaches Lord Campbell&#8217;s hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall not reach them,&#8221; said Tom, firmly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give my life, if need be, to prevent
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the door was pushed rudely
open and Jasper Harwood strode into the
apartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said he, angrily. &#8220;I find you
here, do I! I&#8217;ve been bawling all over the
place for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Laura, sir,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;and just
paused for a moment to speak to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; growled he, not seeming to relish
this explanation in the least, &#8220;now that you
have spoken with her, suppose you come into
the dining-hall and not keep my guests waiting
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom pressed Laura&#8217;s hands in hurried
thanks; his glowing eyes told her how grateful
he was for the information which she had
just given him. In it he saw a chance to
serve his country and make a name for himself
at the same time.</p>

<p>The planter led him through the hall, into
the room in which his dragoon guests were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
assembled. The table contained some bottles;
and, as though by chance, the sword of each
dragoon lay near him ready to hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Mark Harwood, as Tom entered,
at the planter&#8217;s heels. &#8220;Here you are
at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something like a sneer in his
tone as he said this; the officers seemed to
see a hidden meaning in them, for they
laughed boisterously and hammered the table
with their glasses. They made room, however,
for the boy at the head of the table, as
though anxious to do him honor. Cheyne,
the lieutenant who had tortured Cole so barbarously,
slapped him familiarly upon the
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, fall to, youngster. You&#8217;re a pretty
sprout of a king&#8217;s man, and a king&#8217;s man
should never shirk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In these times of rebellion,&#8221; said Mark
Harwood reaching forward and filling a
goblet, which stood upon the table before
Tom, &#8220;good, loyal subjects are rare. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
let us treat them well when they visit
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Deering flashed the young Tory a
rapid glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, take your glass, my lad,&#8221; cried
Cheyne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; shouted the others, holding their
own bumpers aloft, and laughing expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, gentlemen,&#8221; said the soft voice of
Mark Harwood. &#8220;I was about to propose a
toast!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A toast! A toast!&#8221; The dragoons sprang
to their feet as one man, glasses in hand. Tom
knew by the sudden malice of his Tory cousin&#8217;s
look that it was for this that he had been
invited into the dining-hall. Something was
about to occur&mdash;something by which he was
to be humiliated before these British soldiers.
But with flashing eyes he, too, arose and faced
the Tory. Mark raised his glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I give you the
king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The king!&#8221; they shouted and were about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
to drain their goblets when Cheyne stayed
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; requested he. &#8220;Our
young friend here does not seem disposed to
honor the toast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angry looks came from all sides. The sly,
oily voice of Mark Harwood reached Tom&#8217;s
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mistake, gentlemen,&#8221; said Mark.
&#8220;Of course he will join us.&#8221;</p>

<p>By his look Mark was daring Tom to refuse;
like a flash the latter saw the plan and
his cheeks flushed with resentment. The
young Tory thought he would be afraid to
refuse. In the glance that Tom had darted
about the room a few moments before he saw
Laura, unnoticed, standing with frightened
face in the doorway; come what may he
would not be humiliated before her, above all
others.</p>

<p>&#8220;The toast!&#8221; cried the dragoons, eagerly,
all their eyes fixed upon him with threatening
looks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;Very well, gentlemen.&#8221; Tom quietly put
down the glass and took up a goblet of water.
&#8220;I will drink a toast with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he will,&#8221; laughed Jasper Harwood,
his hard face glowing with triumph at
what he took to be an exhibition of cowardice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never had the slightest doubt of it,&#8221;
sneered Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, gentlemen, I will give you a toast
that any honest man can drink.&#8221; He looked
about at the expectant British officers and
then at the sneering Tories; his voice was
steady, his hand never trembled. &#8220;I give
you the Provincial Congress!&#8221; Amid dead
silence he lifted the cool water to his lips and
took a sip; then he threw the glass into the
middle of the table, where it smashed into a
hundred pieces, as he shouted, &#8220;Down with
the king!&#8221;</p>

<p>The dragoons grasped their sabres, but he
was through the door, out at a window and
upon his horse&#8217;s back before they could act.
They crowded through the front door and ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
along the path toward the place where their
horses were; but Tom was already out upon
the road waving his hat at them defiantly.
Wheeling his fleet steed he dashed down the
narrow road, then suddenly pulled up with a
cry of delight. Almost directly in his path
was Cole, a wide grin upon his ebony face;
upon a long rope he had the dragoons&#8217; horses,
and at the word was ready to make off with
them. The British officers discovered their
loss almost at the same moment, and they
ran down the rough road, brandishing their
sabres and shouting a volley of most dreadful
threats.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take them along with us, Cole,&#8221; said
Tom, laughing. &#8220;Lord Campbell can get
another supply, but Colonel Moultrie would
appreciate them very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, despite the threats that rang in his ears,
Tom Deering rode gaily away behind his first
capture from the enemy. Seeing that he had
no intention of surrendering their mounts,
the dragoons soon gave up the chase and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
returned in no very sweet tempers to the
mansion of their Tory host.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late that night, Lieutenant Gordon Cheyne,
of Tarleton&#8217;s Dragoons, rode slowly, upon a
borrowed horse, along a deserted road in the
neighborhood of Charleston. Suddenly, as he
turned a bend, and just at a place where the
woods grew thick upon each side of the road,
a horseman rode into his path and presented
a pistol at his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand!&#8221; ordered the newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; demanded the lieutenant,
pulling up suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your despatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cheyne started, and his hand crept toward
his holster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make no movement toward a weapon,&#8221;
said the horseman. &#8220;Give me the despatches,
and give me them quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry Cheyne drew a packet from his
breast and threw it at the horseman. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
latter caught it deftly and stuffed it into his
boot leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;about face and return to
those who sent you.&#8221; The officer of dragoons
wheeled and set off, in a fury, down the road.
&#8220;And tell them,&#8221; called the horseman after
him, &#8220;that the Provincial Congress has a
thousand eyes.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>HOW THE BRITISH SHIPS RAN FROM CHARLESTON
HARBOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 9th of November, which was but a
few days previous to Tom Deering&#8217;s adventure
with the British, the Provincial Congress of
South Carolina resolved &#8220;by every military
operation to oppose the passage of any British
armament&#8221;; and this order was issued to the
commandant at Fort Johnson, Colonel Moultrie.
The fort itself was strengthened, more
men were enlisted, and bills of credit were
issued. The blow for which all had been
waiting seemed now about to be struck; the
redcoats and patriots were about to grapple
in that fierce struggle which was to last eight
long years and set a continent free.</p>

<p>Colonel Moultrie had taken up his headquarters
at Haddrill&#8217;s Point, which was being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
fortified; it was here that the training of his
men was going forward, and the place had
the appearance of quite a formidable camp.</p>

<p>The eastern sky was beginning to gray
under the hand of approaching morning,
when the sentinel on guard at the upper
road caught the sound of flying hoofs rapidly
approaching him. His musket quickly
came around and he stood ready to receive
friend or foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The galloping horse was pulled up so
quickly as to almost throw him back upon
his haunches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; demanded the sentry.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend,&#8221; came the voice of Tom Deering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Advance, friend, with the countersign.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom walked his snorting horse forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not received the countersign,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;But I have urgent business with Colonel
Moultrie, and must see him at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Against orders,&#8221; said the sentry. &#8220;I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
call out the sergeant of the guard, though,
and leave him to settle it with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments the sergeant had presented
himself. Tom was led forward into
the light of a camp-fire, where the sergeant
carefully questioned him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can answer no questions,&#8221; said the boy,
&#8220;unless asked by Colonel Moultrie or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Marion, perhaps,&#8221; said a voice
behind him.</p>

<p>Tom turned quickly; within a foot of him
was the small, dark officer with the aquiline
nose and the burning black eyes, whom he
had carried across the river in his skiff on the
night when Fort Johnson was taken.</p>

<p>Francis Marion was, at this time, past his
fortieth year. He had been a planter, his
only previous military experience having
been in the war with the Cherokees some
years before; in this he had gained some
fame as a leader of a &#8220;forlorn hope&#8221; at the
battle of Etchoee, in which the Carolinians
had defeated the French and Indians. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
he had been a lieutenant in the regiment of
Middleton. Colonel Moultrie, who was in
command of the patriot forces, had been captain
of the company in which Marion served
at that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Marion, &#8220;you would like to see
Colonel Moultrie, would you, my lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom, holding the bridle of his horse with
one hand, raised the other in salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, captain,&#8221; answered he promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Marion, &#8220;I owe you something
for your service that night on the
river.&#8221; He laughed lightly. &#8220;You see, I
have not forgotten it; nor have I forgotten
the fact that you, single handed and alone,
captured a fortified position.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Marion was pleased to regard
Tom&#8217;s errand lightly, it seemed; a boy must
always prove that his doings are worth the
consideration of his elders. In spite of the
fact that he recognized in Tom Deering no
ordinary lad, Marion could not accept his
word that his business with Colonel Moultrie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
was not some hair brained freak. Tom saw
all this in the dark, smiling face of the soldier
before him; and he recognized the fact that
he must come down to plain dealing and
take him into the matter before he could
hope to see the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Marion,&#8221; said Tom, with a glance
at the sergeant and his file of listening men,
&#8220;can I have a word in private with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Still smiling, Marion led the boy a little
way apart, but well out of earshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you consider it a serious matter,&#8221;
asked Tom, looking him candidly in the eye,
&#8220;if the British ships came up and bombarded
the city in the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion&#8217;s face grew grave, and he glanced
keenly at the boy&#8217;s intent face, an alert look
stealing into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would consider it very serious,&#8221; said he,
in reply, his voice sober and low.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is to be such an attack to-night,&#8221;
said Tom. He drew the captured despatches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
from his boot leg, and held them out. &#8220;This
packet I took from an officer of Tarleton&#8217;s
dragoons two hours ago, some distance below
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you examined them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, in order to make sure that I was
not at fault. I did not wish to come here
with nothing to substantiate my statement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion took the packet and glanced hurriedly
through the papers. After a moment&#8217;s
examination he said, quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a quarter of an hour a dozen officers
were gathered in Colonel Moultrie&#8217;s cabin
in the center of the encampment. The captured
papers were before them; Tom Deering
stood at the table answering the questions
with which they plied him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This attempt seems mere madness,&#8221; said
Colonel Moultrie, at length. &#8220;How do they
hope to get their vessels past the fortified
points without danger of being destroyed?&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>MARION TOOK THE PACKET</i><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>This seemed to be the general opinion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the council; but Marion, who happened to
glance at Tom at that moment, saw an eager
light in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak out, lad,&#8221; said he, kindly. &#8220;If you
have anything to say upon this question I
have no doubt but that Colonel Moultrie will
be glad to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;You have
done us too great a service already, my boy,
for us to refuse to listen to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just wanted to say, sir,&#8221; exclaimed Tom,
eagerly, &#8220;that the British ships can get up to
the city, and without the slightest danger to
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel looked startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure of what you say?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am positive. They can come up by way
of Hog-Island channel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is not deep enough for their
heavy vessels,&#8221; cried an officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;At high water,&#8221; said Tom Deering, calmly,
&#8220;there is water enough to float the largest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
ship in their fleet, providing they have a man
at the wheel who knows the course. I have
come through the channel many a time with
my uncle, Captain Deering, of the schooner
Defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>This information set the council in a state
of great excitement; Tom was thanked over
and over for what he had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have, without doubt,&#8221; said Colonel
Moultrie, &#8220;saved us from making a fatal
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the sun was three hours high a plan
of action had been formulated and was in
progress of execution. Captain Deering was
summoned in hot haste from his schooner,
which lay in the river, and ordered to cover
and protect a party detailed to sink a number
of stone-laden hulks in the narrow Hog-Island
channel. The Defence, some weeks
before, had been fitted up with carronades
and a long thirty pounder cannon, and she
was just the ready, quick-sailing craft for the
work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>By early afternoon the hulks were being
floated into the channel, the Defence hovering
about them like a great bird watching over
its young. The work had scarcely begun,
however, when the British lookouts discovered
it, and the Tamar bore down upon the
hulks, firing from her bow guns as she came.
The Cherokee was only a little behind her
sister craft in promptness of action, and
opened with her lighter guns, also. The Defence
answered with her carronades, but their
range was not great enough, and she did but
little damage; the guns from Fort Johnson
opened; a few shots were effective; but the
firing was discontinued as soon as the British
war-ships showed signs of hesitation. Meanwhile
the alarm was beat at Charleston, where
the troops stood to their arms. But the time
was not yet; the Tamar and Cherokee, seeing
that they could not frighten the blockading
party off, went about and retreated beyond
range.</p>

<p>From this time on the local patriots began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to proceed vigorously. Ships were impressed
and armed like the Defence, and they were
badly needed, for the British in the harbor
became more and more troublesome. Captain
Thornborough, the officer in command of
them, began to seize all vessels within his
reach, entering or coming out of the port.</p>

<p>Of the newly-gathered fleet of the Americans
Captain Deering was placed in charge. Heavy
artillery was mounted on Haddrill&#8217;s Point and
the work of fortification at the same place was
hurriedly completed. A new fort was raised
on Jones&#8217; Island and another one begun on
Sullivan&#8217;s Island, some distance below the
city; the volunteers were constantly coming
in, swelling the ranks of the patriots both
ashore and afloat. Among these latter was
Tom Deering&#8217;s father; the planter armed a
small sloop and manned it with a crew of
slaves, who gladly offered to follow him
against the British.</p>

<p>But Tom, to his father&#8217;s surprise, refused to
join him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;Is it possible, Tom,&#8221; demanded he, sternly,
on the morning upon which he formally took
charge of the sloop as an officer of the colony,
&#8220;that you have suddenly grown faint-hearted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faint-hearted! I!&#8221; Tom looked at his
father reproachfully. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think that,
father, surely! Have I not done some service,
already, for the cause of liberty?&mdash;not much,
of course, but still, enough to prove that I am
ready to go to any length against oppression.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done some things,&#8221; said Mr.
Deering, his eyes alight with pride, &#8220;that
have made me thank the good God who had
given me such a son. But,&#8221; and his face
grew grave once more, &#8220;it seems strange that
you will not enter the service of the colony,
now that she needs you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought the matter over very carefully,&#8221;
answered Tom, &#8220;and have concluded
that I shall be better as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; his father&#8217;s face grew white.
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;If I enlist,&#8221; returned Tom, &#8220;I shall be
forced to march in the ranks and obey orders.
If I remain free, I can do as I will; and by
so doing I can render much more effective
service. Those despatches which I captured
are not the only ones that will be carried
through the outlying districts under the cover
of night; there is information to be gained of
the enemy&#8217;s movements and plans, by one
who knows the roads, the cane-brakes and
swamps, and has the courage to dare the
British dragoons. This is the work that I
have laid out for myself, father, in this fight.
And this is the work, I think, that I can
best do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; The planter clasped his hand
and threw one arm about him; &#8220;forgive me
for what I have said. I might have known,
my lad&mdash;I might have known.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole of the long winter and spring
passed; the British had all retreated to their
ships; while the colonists were deeply absorbed
in preparations for the defence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
city. Inland, parties of loyalists, or Tories,
had risen and were slaying and burning,
but their ravages were confined to a small
district as yet. Jasper Harwood, Tom&#8217;s half-uncle,
and his son Mark, were at the head of
a band of these partisans, and they were carrying
terror wherever they went. Moultrie sent
small parties in pursuit, now and then; but
these only served to check the outrages for a
space; when the patriots once more returned
to the city the slaying and burnings were at
once renewed.</p>

<p>Tom did splendid service against these desperate
bands. In company with Cole, his
giant servant, he penetrated very frequently
into their districts, and often gained information
that saved both lives and property. During
this time, Marion, now a major, was in
command of the depot of supplies at Dorchester
and it was with his small force that Tom
was most frequently in touch. In this way
he came to realize the genius and resolution
of this small, kindly man with the burning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
deep-set, black eyes; for at no time was he
unready to spring into the saddle and dash at
the head of his men to the rescue of some
imperiled section; at no time was his invention
at fault for a plan of onset or ambush.</p>

<p>But the constant rumors of the coming of
a strong fleet to reinforce the Cherokee and
Tamar caused Marion to ask for a change of
post to Charleston, where he would be more
actively engaged. This was granted him; he
was once more appointed to the Second Regiment
under Colonel Moultrie and stationed
at Fort Sullivan, on the island of that name
which stands at the entrance to Charleston
harbor and within point-blank shot of the
channel. Tom, during the long months at
Dorchester had become devoted to Marion
and this, together with the expectation of a
battle, caused him to follow him to Fort Sullivan&mdash;or
Fort Moultrie as it was then called,
in honor of its commandant.</p>

<p>Tom helped to build the fort; for when
he arrived there it was scarcely more than an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
outline. It was constructed of palmetto logs,
a simple square, with a bastion at each angle,
sufficient to cover a thousand men. The logs
were laid one upon another in parallel rows,
at a distance of sixteen feet, bound together
with heavier timbers which were dovetailed
and bolted into the logs. The work of constructing
this fort was a good preparatory
lesson for the great conflict that was to follow.
Tom grew brown and tough and sinewy with
the long days of labor in the sun; the wonderful
strength of Cole, the dumb-slave, was
a constant source of astonishment to both
officers and men; to the amazement of all he
would lift, unaided, a great piece of massy
timber to crown an embrasure and set it in
place, or, when horses were scarce, go down
on the beach and drag the ponderous tree
trunks from the water. At sight of the open-eyed
astonishment of those about him he
would throw back his head, his white teeth
shining in two even rows, and laugh with the
perfect glee of a child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>In spite of the incessant labor of the soldiers
the fort was still unfinished when the
recently arrived and powerful British fleet
appeared before its walls. Colonel Moultrie&#8217;s
force consisted of four hundred and thirty-five
men, rank and file, comprising four hundred
and thirteen of the Second Regiment,
and twenty-two of the Fourth Artillery. The
fort at this time mounted thirty-one guns;
nine were French twenty-sixes; six, English
eighteens; the remainder were twelve and
nine pounders.</p>

<p>The day before the British hove in sight,
Tom Deering was witness to an exciting
scene which took place between General
Charles Lee, whom the Continental Congress
at Philadelphia had recently sent to take
command of the Army of the South, and
Colonel Moultrie. The two officers were
standing upon a bastion, looking seaward;
Tom and Cole were bolting some timbers
together, near at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is madness to attempt a defence of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
point,&#8221; said General Lee. &#8220;The fleet is even
now in the roadstead and the works, here, are
far from being finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I disagree with you, general,&#8221; returned
Colonel Moultrie.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Colonel Moultrie,&#8221; cried General
Lee, not seeming to relish having his opinion
so candidly opposed, &#8220;how are you going to
defend yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the guns of the fort,&#8221; said the colonel;
&#8220;and the brave men who will be behind
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All very well, my dear sir, if it were
Frenchmen or Spaniards who manned the attacking
fleet; but they are British ships, sir!
British ships, and sailed by British tars!&#8221;</p>

<p>General Charles Lee had been trained in
the English army, and he had, perhaps, naturally
enough, an overweening respect for
the prowess of an English fleet. It is fortunate
that this feeling of awe was not shared
by Colonel Moultrie and his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them once get within range of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
heavy guns,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;and it will
make no difference as to what nation they
belong. We shall make them run from
Charleston harbor, just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fort presents, at present, little more
than a front to the sea,&#8221; protested General
Lee. &#8220;Once let them get into the position
for enfilading and you cannot maintain your
position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will risk it,&#8221; said Colonel Moultrie.
His officers were with him in this; and Lee&#8217;s
authority was not great enough to force them
to evacuate their position against their will.</p>

<p>On the 20th day of June, 1776, the British
ships of war, nine in number, and consisting
of two vessels of fifty guns, five of twenty-eight,
one of twenty-six, and a small bomb-vessel,
sailed up the harbor under the able
command of Sir Peter Parker. They drew
abreast of the fort, let go their anchors with
springs upon their cables, and began a terrible
bombardment. They strove, after a time, to
gain a position for the destructive enfilading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
fire which General Lee so feared; but the Defence,
the Tartar sloop, commanded by Tom&#8217;s
father, and several other small vessels, came
down boldly and maintained such a stubborn
resistance, that Sir Peter quickly displayed
signals ordering the attempt to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Fort Moultrie at the beginning of the fight
had but five thousand pounds of powder;
this small supply had to be used with great
care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a shot must be wasted,&#8221; cried Colonel
Moultrie; &#8220;every one must do execution.
Let each officer in command of a gun aim it
in person.&#8221;</p>

<p>This command was obeyed, and its results
were frightfully fatal to the British and their
ships. In the battle the Bristol, Sir Peter&#8217;s
flag-ship, lost forty killed and wounded; Sir
Peter himself lost one of his arms; the Experiment,
another fifty gun vessel, lost about
twice as many. The fire of the fort was directed
mainly at the heavy craft. Tom Deering,
as he toiled with rammer and sponge at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
one of the French twenty-six pounders, of
which Marion had charge, heard that little
officer constantly call to his brother gunners:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look to the Commodore&mdash;look to the
heavy ships; they can do us most damage!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the heat of the action the Acteon, one of
the smaller of the enemy&#8217;s ships, being hard
pressed by the Defence and Tartar, ran
aground and immediately took fire. At this
point the British Commodore would have
been forced to strike his colors, or be destroyed,
but suddenly the powder ran out and
the fire of the fort slackened and finally
ceased altogether.</p>

<p>Struck with astonishment at this the
British also ceased their fire, thinking the
fort had been abandoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must secure ammunition,&#8221; cried
Colonel Moultrie, his face ashen. Here was
victory all but in his grasp, and to have to
give it up would be almost fatal in its effect
upon his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;The schooner Defence has a large supply,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
said Marion, to his commander, as he
wiped the black powder stains from his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she is nowhere in sight,&#8221; said Moultrie,
sweeping the harbor with his glass.</p>

<p>Tom stepped forward, his hand at the
salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; demanded the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the Defence chased into Stone Gap
Creek awhile ago,&#8221; stated the lad eagerly.
&#8220;She is safe, though, for see,&#8221; and he pointed
shoreward, &#8220;there are her topmasts above the
trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; exclaimed Marion, his face lighting
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can we reach her? The enemy&#8217;s
vessels will not allow her to come out,&#8221; said
the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go to her,&#8221; ventured Tom, hesitatingly,
for it seemed presumptuous for him
to offer a suggestion to his commander. &#8220;The
Tartar is lying under the guns of the fort.
We could reach the Defence in her. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
British could not follow us up the creek; they
draw too much water.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ammunition that remained on board
the Tartar, save a few rounds, Tom&#8217;s father
gladly gave up to Colonel Moultrie, and a
few guns resumed service from the fort, but
firing slowly. Under mainsail and jib the
gallant little sloop then stood out, in the
teeth of the British, heading for the creek
where the Defence was lying. Major Marion,
Tom Deering and Cole stood upon her deck,
watching a brig-of-war which had just started
to head them off.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a fast sailer,&#8221; said Mr. Deering, a
shade passing over his face, after he had
watched the quality of their pursuer for a few
moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think she can overhaul us?&#8221;
asked Major Marion.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no question about it,&#8221; returned
the planter, &#8220;if she is given time enough.
But the distance to the creek is short; we
may reach there. Then, with the help of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Defence, we can fight her off on the return
run.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tartar had arrived within hailing
distance of the mouth of the creek, when the
brig suddenly discharged a lucky shot from a
long bow gun that splintered the sloop&#8217;s mast
and left her lying a helpless hulk upon the
waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all over,&#8221; said Marion, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boat remains,&#8221; said Mr. Deering.
&#8220;Quick. You have still time to gain the
Defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, father?&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remain with the sloop,&#8221; answered the
planter.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will be taken prisoner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not leave my crew,&#8221; said his father,
firmly. &#8220;There is not room for us all in the
single yawl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will remain, also,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will join Major Marion in the boat,&#8221;
commanded the planter, evenly. &#8220;Carolina
has need of all her youth. It would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
a needless sacrifice for you to throw yourself
into the hands of her enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite the boy&#8217;s protests, his father remained
firm; so with a heavy heart Tom
climbed into the boat with Marion. Cole
would have remained behind with his master;
but the planter, who recognized the
great attachment of the giant black to his
son, and saw how valuable he would be
during these dangerous times, promptly ordered
him, also, into the yawl.</p>

<p>They were just pulling into Stone Gap
when a small boat with an armed crew left
the British brig and pulled for the wrecked
Tartar. So it happened that Roger Deering
was one of the first prisoners of war taken in
Carolina.</p>

<p>Apparently the British skipper did not
realize the significance of the sloop&#8217;s errand;
for after taking her crew from her she set fire
to the hull and sailed back to rejoin the other
vessels in the line of battle.</p>

<p>An hour later the Defence crept out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Stone Gap Creek and headed for Fort Moultrie.
She was a swift sailer, and the old
salt who commanded her knew how to make
her do her best. So, in spite of pursuit and
flying shot, she anchored under the guns of
the fort and quickly transferred her powder.
The British, during the protracted lull in the
fort&#8217;s fire, had drawn closer; but now, under
the brisk and accurate cannonade they withdrew
again to their first position. The fight
then continued, hotter than ever; shortly
afterward the fort received another supply
of powder from the city, which did much to
encourage the defenders.</p>

<p>The cheers, however, that greeted the arrival
of the ammunition had scarcely died
away when a distant roar of voices raised in
exultation came from the British fleet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look; the flag,&#8221; cried some one.</p>

<p>A solid shot from one of the flag-ship&#8217;s
heavy guns had carried away the flag and it
fell, fluttering like a wounded bird, outside
the walls of the fort. In an instant Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Deering, who was once more helping to serve
the gun, threw his rammer to Cole and leaped
upon the wall. A storm of canister swept
about him and a hundred voices shouted for
him to return; but, without hesitation he
leaped to the sandy beach below, between the
ramparts and the enemy, seized the fallen
colors, stuffed them into his bosom and then
with the help of the mighty, outstretched arm
of Cole, scrambled back inside.</p>

<p>Again the flag was run up to the top of the
staff, by means of fresh halyards; the sight
of it seemed to give the colonists renewed
courage, for they turned to the conflict with
a resolution that was unconquerable. The
British ships were fast becoming mere
wrecks, so seeing that a continuation of
the combat would be mere folly, the
signal flags were flown at the masthead of
Commodore Parker&#8217;s vessel to cease firing.
Ten minutes afterward a fleet of ships, with
sails hanging from the rigging in shot-rent
rags, and with hulls battered, leaking and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
torn with canister, ran out of Charleston
harbor in disorder.</p>

<p>&#8220;They carry your father with them, a prisoner,&#8221;
said Major Marion, to Tom Deering, as
they leaned, watching, upon a hot gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they shall not keep him,&#8221; cried the
lad, &#8220;to die in their prison hulks! He shall
be free! I am only a boy; but the whole
British navy shall not keep me from him.
It may be a month, a year, or even more, but
he shall be free in spite of all the fleets and
armies they can send!&#8221;</p>

<small>HOW TWO MEN BURIED A CHEST OF GOLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> battle of Fort Moultrie was of immense
importance to all the confederated states. It
happened before the Declaration of Independence
was passed at Philadelphia. Because
of the slowness of travel in those days the
news did not become known in the capital
city and other points of the north for a month
or more afterward; but it served to strengthen
the patriots in their cause, and that went for
much in that dark hour of doubt.</p>

<p>For three years the British made no further
attempt to invade Carolina.</p>

<p>During this time Tom Deering saw service
against the Cherokees and Tories; but the
greater part of his time was devoted to trying
to find his father. He and Cole used
every means in their power to find where the
planter had been taken; more than once they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
assumed the characters of loyalists, when they
saw a British ship standing in near shore, and
with a boat-load of fresh vegetables they
would pull or sail out to her under pretence
of desiring to sell the things to the officers.
But all their questioning upon these and
other occasions went for nothing; no trace
was to be had of his father. But Tom was
not disheartened; the finding of his father
was to be his task, and he persisted in it
day after day, week after week; wherever
there promised to be a shred of information,
there he rode, sailed or walked. But not once
in the entire three years did he gain a single
clue.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, came the surprise of General
Howe at Savannah; the Americans were
dispersed and the city fell into the hands of
the British. Ten thousand picked troops
under Sir Henry Clinton sailed from New
York upon Charleston, bringing a train of
heavy artillery. Six weeks after the city was
invested it fell, and four thousand men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
taken prisoners; the command of the British
then was given to Lord Cornwallis, and at
once the entire colony began to feel the gross
abuse of power and wanton tyrannies with
which that officer soiled his name.</p>

<p>Tom Deering, between his marches in the
Cherokee and Tory countries had found much
time to attend to the plantation. Nothing
had been heard of his father since the day
the boat&#8217;s crew of the brig-of-war took him
from the wrecked sloop, so the whole care of
the extensive estate now fell upon the boy.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s mother had died when he was but a
child, and he had no brothers or sisters.
The only relatives he knew of, in the wide
world, other than Captain Deering were the
Harwoods, and these, of course, he never saw,
as they had not ventured into the neighborhood
of Charleston since once taking arms
against their neighbors. Tom was now a stalwart,
bronzed youth of about nineteen; hard
riding had developed him wonderfully in body
and constant danger had given him that calm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
steady, tried courage that is a soldier&#8217;s best
gift.</p>

<p>The Deering mansion was crowded with
many objects of value in the way of plate,
pictures and antique carvings, of which his
father had been a tireless collector. Upon
looking over the books of the plantation one
day, Tom discovered that there was also about
four thousand pounds in gold in the house,
his father having drawn all his money out of
the banks at the first sign of trouble between
the colony and Great Britain. This was a
very large sum and its possession troubled the
boy not a little. The money was locked up
in a heavy oaken chest in his father&#8217;s private
room; and when the news reached him that
Sir Henry Clinton was in the outer roadstead,
he set about finding a hiding-place for it, his
judgment telling him that the city was in
danger.</p>

<p>He and Cole opened the chest one night;
the broad gold pieces, mostly Spanish, were
tied up in stout bags.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;If the enemy storm and demolish Fort
Moultrie,&#8221; said Tom, as he looked reflectively
at the bags, &#8220;they will be very keen after
hard money to pay off their men and obtain
fresh supplies. So they would not hesitate a
moment in seizing upon this if they chanced
upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hiding-place must be a secret known
only to themselves; the slaves upon the plantation
could be trusted to the last one; but if
the dragoons of Tarleton suspected the presence
of treasure upon the place, they would
terrorize the negroes by threats of torture and
compel them to tell where it was hidden.</p>

<p>Some distance from the house, in the middle
of an orchard, was an old well, the waters
of which were used in dry weather to keep
the young trees in good condition. As a
small boy Tom had often lowered himself
into its dark depths in a spirit of exploration;
and now, as he cast his mind about for a safe
place to conceal the gold, the well occurred
to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;I have it, Cole,&#8221; exclaimed he, cheerfully.
&#8220;The old well in the orchard is the place;
about half-way down, a large stone fell out a
long time ago, and behind the bed where the
stone lay we can dig out a hole large enough
to contain all the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole nodded delightedly; in his opinion it
was just the thing. So out they went, at a
side door at the upper end of the house to
prepare the hiding-place. Cole carried a long
rope, for Tom decided not to trust his weight
to the well rope, which was old and very
likely rotten; they also had a masked
lantern, a short iron bar and a small spade.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must be careful and not be seen,&#8221; said
Tom, as they picked their way through the
garden. &#8220;The Tories are drawing in close, at
the expectation of a British victory; and if
one of them saw us prowling about in the
darkness he would suspect something at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the well in a very few minutes,
and he at once set to work to descend.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Cole formed a sling at one end of the rope
and passed it about Tom&#8217;s body. The boy
had the masked lantern fastened to his belt;
the spade and bar were lying upon the low
curb of the well; he was just about to swing
himself down into the black hole when suddenly
there came a low, sullen shock as of
distant thunder, followed by another and another.
The eyes of the boy and the giant
went instantly in the direction of the harbor;
a flare of light ran along the sky, and immediately
vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;The British!&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;That was
their big guns that spoke; and they are firing
rockets, too. They mean to attack the fort in
the darkness. We are none too soon, Cole;
for there is no knowing what will happen
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole&#8217;s strong arms lowered him slowly into
the well, and he soon found the place he
sought. A large and almost square stone had
fallen out and behind where it had lain in the
lining of the shaft the earth could be seen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Tom carefully pried out some few other and
smaller stones with the bar; these he passed
up to Cole, after which he set to work with
the spade to dig an aperture sufficiently large
to hold the sacks of gold.</p>

<p>As he worked he could hear the steady
growl of the distant guns; above his head he
could see but a small, round spot in the sky
through the shaft of the well; and every little
while this small, round spot would be lit up
by a sudden glare of rockets sent hissing into
the heavens as signals to the captains of the
attacking fleet.</p>

<p>In about half an hour Tom&#8217;s task was completed.
Cole was signaled and hauled him
out of the well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;let&#8217;s get the bags down.
It will be daybreak, almost, when we finish
with this matter; and we want to be done
with it before any of the hands are stirring.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached Mr. Deering&#8217;s office,
Tom was about to open the chest once more
and take the bags out for transportation to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
orchard. But a gesture from Cole stopped
him. With an ease that made even Tom&#8217;s
eyes open in wonder, and the lad was
accustomed to Cole&#8217;s exhibitions of tremendous
strength, the giant slave hoisted the chest
upon his back, and motioned to his master
to go before him and open the doors. It was
a dead weight and sufficient to crush an
ordinary man; but Cole carried it downstairs,
through the wide hall, out into the
garden, and thence to the orchard, where he
lowered it to the ground with scarcely a
labored breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cole,&#8221; said Tom Deering in astonishment,
&#8220;I believe you are a second cousin to an
elephant! You&#8217;re growing stronger every
day!&#8221;</p>

<p>The great slave grinned; he took a childish
pleasure in his enormous power, and it made
him happy when notice was taken of it by
Tom, or his father. The sacks were now
taken out of the chest, and once more the
lad was swung down into the well, carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
several of them in his arms. Quite a number
of trips were necessary before the gold was
all stored in the hollow behind the stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;we must block up the
opening. It will not do to allow it to remain
as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some lime was procured from a barrel in
the negro quarters, slacked and quickly
mixed with sand and water.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very good mortar,&#8221; remarked
Tom, &#8220;but it will have to answer, as it&#8217;s the
best we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stones that had been removed were
replaced in the side of the well, and another
was procured to replace the one that had
fallen out; then all were cemented firmly in
place, and all trace of the work destroyed.
After they had finished, Tom breathed a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It will take a sharp
eye to discover that, I fancy. It is secure
there until the times grow settled and father
is released on parole or exchanged.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>They had reached the side door, at the
upper end of the house, carrying the chest
between them, and were just about to go in,
when Tom suddenly laid his hand warningly
upon the big slave&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move,&#8221; whispered he. &#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood as silent as graven images.
The soft &#8220;pit-pat&#8221; of cautious footsteps
was approaching, down a narrow path between
two high screens of hedge. The
shadows by the doorway lay deep and black,
but the path leading to it was flooded by
moonlight. A night bird flew by, overhead,
crying harshly and sharply in the stillness.
The footfalls had now ceased, but there
immediately followed a rustling in the hedge.
The next moment the stiff growth parted and
a face was thrust through&mdash;a pale, sly looking
face with narrow eyes and a crafty expression.
It was that of Mark Harwood!</p>

<p>The shadow was too deep about the doorway
for the prowling Tory to see our friends,
however; he remained glancing here and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
for a moment, then his head was withdrawn
and his soft footfalls once more fell upon the
listener&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>For a moment Tom had been startled; he
had thought that the Tory had been watching
their labors, and that the whereabouts of the
treasure was known. But a moment&#8217;s reflection
convinced him that this could not be so.
Mark had approached the house from an entirely
different direction, and was apparently
endeavoring to find out if any one was astir.</p>

<p>Assured that the hiding-place of his
father&#8217;s money was not known to Mark, Tom
at once conceived the notion of playing the
Tory a trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cole,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;did you hear any
other footsteps than his?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be alone,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Perhaps
he has come out ahead of his father&#8217;s band of
thieving loyalists to look the ground over.
They always did envy my father his prosperity,
Cole, and now they think they&#8217;ll have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
a chance to rob him, seeing that the British
are near at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he spoke, Tom was thinking of
another matter; suddenly he clapped the
negro on the back and laughed low and gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan,&#8221; said he, eagerly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
fool them; we&#8217;ll let them think they have the
matter in their own hands. Now, do just
what I tell you, and don&#8217;t hesitate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark had stolen off around a corner of
the house, and his footsteps had died away.
Tom unlocked the door at which they were
standing, opened it wide and suddenly clapped
it shut with a resounding slam. Cole started
in surprise, but Tom reassured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take hold of the handle of the chest,&#8221;
whispered the lad, &#8220;and act as though it were
very heavy. We&#8217;ll lug it to the maize field
just below the quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole took hold of the chest, and they bore
it along through the garden, around the
house, over a low wall and through the silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
street of the negro quarters. As they went,
Tom glanced over his shoulder now and then,
while they passed through a deep shadow, and
at last he was rewarded by seeing the skulking
figure of Mark Harwood, creeping along
in the shadow of a fence, behind them. As
Tom had expected, the loud closing of the
door had attracted him; and when he saw
the young patriot and his servant carrying a
chest in a secretive fashion, and in the dark
of the very early morning, he eagerly followed
them.</p>

<p>When Tom and Cole reached the maize
field they put the chest down at a fence corner.
The crown of Mark Harwood&#8217;s wide
wool hat was plainly visible to Tom&#8217;s watchful
eyes, sticking above a bush behind which
he was crouching. Tom was careful not to
let the spying Tory know that he was observed;
and in a voice that he knew would
reach the listener, he said to Cole:</p>

<p>&#8220;This will be a good place to bury it. It
won&#8217;t do to let all this gold lie around now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
when there is danger of the enemy coming.
We&#8217;ll bury it here and make a note of the
spot; when everything is quiet again, and
the Tories gone, we can dig it up once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole greeted these words with a long stare
of surprise; Tom was afraid that he did not
understand his words; but, no, it was the
situation that puzzled Cole. But he had
heard the skulking footsteps behind them as
they had lugged the empty chest down to the
maize field, and putting one thing and another
together, the whole thing suddenly
dawned upon him; and he burst into a ringing
laugh that split the silence like a knife.</p>

<p>Tom grasped his arm in pretended alarm,
and covered his mouth with his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; warned he, for the benefit of the
crouching Tory. &#8220;Somebody may hear you.
And it won&#8217;t do to have what we are about
to do, overseen. Keep quiet, now, and go to
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole took up the spade which they had
brought with them, and set to work in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
fence corner, turning up the ground. Tom
found a mattock which a careless hand had
left in the field overnight, and proceeded to
lend vigorous aid. The Tory crouched behind
the bush, eagerly watching; Cole, as
he worked, was so convulsed that his great
shoulders shook, and his eyes gleamed with
enjoyment in the moonlight.</p>

<p>At length they had the hole sufficiently
large; with much burlesque effort they
dragged the chest into it, and proceeded to
throw back and stamp down the earth. Tom
wiped his brow after the job was finished, and
Cole followed suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;There we are,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;Nobody
will ever know that is there. The maize will
soon grow over the spot, and it will never be
noticed.&#8221;</p>

<p>They took up spade and mattock, and
silently set off for the house; behind them
still crouched Mark Harwood, an expression
of malignant triumph upon his cold, sly face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s safe, is it, Tom Deering?&#8221; he muttered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
below his breath. &#8220;That&#8217;s all you
know about it. Sir Henry Clinton will soon
be master of all about here, and father and I
will be masters of the Deering plantation.
Then we shall see if your chest of gold is
safe, or no.&#8221; And with a low laugh, he shook
his fist after the two retreating forms; then
he turned and cut swiftly across the fields, for
day was coming fast and it would not do for
him to be observed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>HOW TOM JOINED MARION&#8217;S BRIGADE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> a week after Tom had hidden his
father&#8217;s four thousand pounds in the old well
Charleston had capitulated, and the army of
General Lincoln was in the hands of the
British. The dragoons of Lieutenant-Colonel
Tarleton overran the whole district between
the city and the Cooper River; the patriot
bands were broken up and scattered in every
direction.</p>

<p>In spite of the peril Tom could scarcely
bring himself to leave the city and its neighborhood.
It seemed like deserting his task,
like seeking safety for himself and leaving
his father to his fate. &#8220;He may be on board
one of those war-ships, Cole,&#8221; said he to the
slave, as they sat in their saddles prepared to
leave the plantation. &#8220;It cuts me to the
heart to go; but to remain means certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
capture, and as a prisoner I could, of course,
do nothing. I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; and he held up his
clinched hand as though making a vow, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll return again. I&#8217;ll never rest content till
my father breathes free air again.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time South Carolina seemed doomed;
defeat followed defeat so rapidly that the
hopes of the colonists were paralyzed, their
spirits subdued. Moultrie, who might have
led them, was a prisoner of war; Governor
Rutledge had withdrawn to the North State
to stir up the people, and win over recruits to
the cause of liberty; even Sumpter, Horry
and like bold spirits had to fly for their lives.</p>

<p>During the siege of Charleston, Francis
Marion had lain with a broken leg in a little
cabin far back in the swamps of the Santee
district. Before the arrival of Clinton and
his army, the little Huguenot had met with
an accident which prevented his taking part
in the defence of the city. Now, when Tarleton
and his men, and the harsh troopers of
Cornwallis, were scouring the country all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
about, he was still confined to his couch. He
was too conspicuous a person, his military
talents had been too well proven, for the
enemy to have forgotten him. So his only
safety was in hiding and watching and waiting
for his hour to strike.</p>

<p>It was just the luck of Tom Deering and
Cole, after escaping from Charleston, to be
pushing through a cane-brake on their way
north one afternoon when dusk was about to
creep out of the east. The section was well
known to the boy and his servant, for they
had ridden over it many times in pursuit of
Tories during the period after the victory at
Sullivan&#8217;s Island. Suddenly a series of shots
rang out, followed by a woman&#8217;s scream; with
one accord our friends spurred forward, their
powerful animals crashing through the growth
in long, swift bounds. In a few moments they
had gained a clearing, in the middle of which
stood a small cabin. The figure of a man
lay before the door and a sobbing woman bent
over him. A riderless horse was cropping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
grass near at hand and a British soldier, desperately
wounded, sat propped against a
stump. Two other troopers and a huge, red-faced
officer&mdash;of high rank, judging from his
uniform&mdash;sat their horses at the edge of the
clearing. The troopers were loading their
pieces; the officer was waving an empty holster
pistol and shouting madly; two young
men, hardly more than boys, were stationed
behind trees, rapidly loading their long ducking
guns, and facing the soldiers.</p>

<p>It required but a glance for Tom Deering to
realize the situation; it was a patriot family
attacked by a party of British. Instantly he
called to Cole, and, without pausing, they
rode at the dragoons. Each had a heavy
cavalry sabre and a pair of large holster pistols;
the sabres were drawn as they charged;
their heavy, curved blades rose in the air,
flashing in the waning light of day. They
were upon the three Englishmen before the
latter realized their presence; Cole&#8217;s great bay
horse, in full career, struck against the lighter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
animal of one of the troopers and sent horse
and man to the ground in a struggling heap.
At the same instant one of the youths behind
the trees near the cabin, having finished reloading
his piece, fired; the other dragoon
fell from his horse with a shattered shoulder.
This left but the burly, red-faced officer still
in the saddle, and without a moment&#8217;s hesitation
Tom dashed at him, his sabre swinging
for a cut.</p>

<p>The officer saw his danger; with a sudden
jerk of his arm he threw the heavy pistol at
the boy&#8217;s head. But Tom avoided the flying
weapon by swiftly leaning to one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surrender!&#8221; he commanded, his sabre
flashing about the officer&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>With a roar of anger like that of an infuriated
bear the Englishman drew his sword
from its scabbard, and the blades crossed with
a sharp, angry ring.</p>

<p>Take care, Tom Deering, take care! Your
boldness has led you into great danger; you
have proved a worthy pupil of Victor St. Mar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
late of King Louis&#8217; army, but, as yet, you are
not a match for Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton,
at once a man of lion-like strength and ferocity
and a master of the sabre.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the terrible Tarleton, himself;
he had been making a short cut through the
swamp in order that he might rejoin a detachment
of his dragoons, when they had
come upon this lonely cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surrender, you jackanapes!&#8221; he roared,
in a fury at Tom&#8217;s bold demand. &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach
you something that you will not forget in a
hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he began a furious attack
upon the boy, aiming sweeping cuts at his
head and downward slashes at his sword-arm
with marvelous rapidity; but Tom, managing
his chestnut mount with his left hand,
guarded himself carefully, allowing no opening
in his defence. But in a few moments
the superior skill and experience of Tarleton,
together with his greater weight, began to tell;
step by step, the boy was driven back, dazzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
by the flashing sabre darting so swiftly here
and there before his eyes. A fierce grin of
triumph came into the Englishman&#8217;s face;
victory was in his hands; this presumptuous
youth who had dared to face him was about
to learn a lesson which he would never forget.</p>

<p>But Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton had not
counted upon Cole. In the very moment of
his triumph, when his heavy blade was lifted
for a last and finishing stroke, a pair of huge,
black arms, as strong as bands of steel, were
thrown about him; his sabre was dashed to
the ground and he, burly man though he
was, found himself plucked from his saddle
and gazing up into the grinning, ebony face
of the giant slave.</p>

<p>Tom looked down, panting from his exertions,
but smiling at the British officer&#8217;s discomfiture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him fast, Cole,&#8221; said he, as the officer
began a desperate struggle to break away
from the bear-like hug which held him. &#8220;No
use in struggling, colonel&#8221;&mdash;the boy perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the captive&#8217;s rank by a glance at his uniform
coat. &#8220;You are in the hands of the strongest
man in South Carolina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You black dog,&#8221; fumed Tarleton, making
a prolonged and desperate struggle to break
free, &#8220;let go, or I&#8217;ll be the death of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole grinned widely; he coolly pinned the
fuming colonel to the ground by the simple
process of kneeling upon his chest; his
splendid white teeth flashed his entire enjoyment
of the whole affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; said Tom, a note of sternness
now in his voice, &#8220;that this affair, here at the
cabin, does not end in your own death. Let
us see what damage you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys who had been stationed behind
the trees defending their home when
Tom and Cole came up, had approached and
were looking with some astonishment at the
herculean black and at the wondrous ease
with which he mastered the powerful king&#8217;s
officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has any one been hurt?&#8221; asked Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;Father has been wounded slightly,&#8221; said
one of the youths. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not much, for
he&#8217;s on his feet again, as you can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who had lain upon the ground at
the cabin door was limping painfully, with
the aid of the woman, to a spring near at
hand. The trooper whom Cole had unhorsed
was attending to the wants of his wounded
comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have surprised you,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;How comes it that soldiers attack the homes
of citizens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;British soldiers,&#8221; said one of the young
men, bitterly, &#8220;do anything these times.
They kill, burn and destroy; it does not
matter much to them who their victims are
so long as they refuse to take up arms for
King George.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are hanging and burning the homes
of all who will not help them,&#8221; spoke the
other youth. &#8220;If a man wants to save his
life or his property he must turn traitor to
his friends&mdash;he must betray his neighbor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
take up arms for a false old madman who
calls himself king!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you swinging at a tree limb for
those words, you traitorous rebel!&#8221; cried
Tarleton, whose arms were now bound behind
him by his belt, and who, under guard of the
watchful Cole, had stood listening to the
young man&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, you red-coated scoundrel!&#8221; exclaimed
the other, wheeling upon him
fiercely; &#8220;take care that you don&#8217;t swing
from yonder cottonwood yourself before the
hour is up. In these times each man in the
swamp-lands of Carolina is a law unto himself.
You have attacked us without cause,
and in strict justice we should treat you as
you would have treated us had you taken us
prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say,&#8221; cried Tom in
horror, &#8220;that regular troops are hanging
prisoners! I thought that only the Tories
would be guilty of such deadly and cowardly
work.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;Colonel Tarleton, here,&#8221; and the young
man pointed one accusing finger at the
British officer, &#8220;has given orders to spare no
one whom they suspect. And as they suspect
all who will not help them, the cane-brakes
are full of fugitives, the clearings show
nothing but burned homes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Tarleton!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, looking
in surprise at the burly form before him,
and into the red, strongly-marked face. &#8220;Is
this Colonel Tarleton?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishman laughed harshly. &#8220;Ah,
I see you have heard of me,&#8221; said he, sneeringly.
&#8220;There are not many in the Santee
district that have not; and there will be many
more, I promise you, before this uprising is
done with. There is only one way to deal
with rebels, and that is to crush them utterly&mdash;to
have no mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And from what I have just heard, and
just seen, too, for that matter, you are acting
upon your theory,&#8221; said Tom Deering, looking
Colonel Tarleton angrily in the eye.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
&#8220;You are a soldier&mdash;serving under the flag of
what should be an enlightened nation; and
do you not know that there is no excuse for
such measures&mdash;that warfare does not sanction
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I plan my own actions and in my own
way,&#8221; returned Tarleton. &#8220;And when I want
advice upon the subject, my forward young
friend, depend upon it, I shall not come to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two young men, as Tom now found,
were Nat and David Collins; they and their
father were wood-cutters in the swamps.
Tom noticed something furtive in their
glances, from time to time, toward the cabin,
which stood some little distance away from
the scene of the fight. Several times he had
made as though to approach it, but they had
always prevented this by calling his attention
elsewhere. But now they were engaged in
attending to their father, who had a painful
wound in the calf of the leg, and Tom
advanced to the cabin door. At another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
time he would not have dreamed of prying
into their affairs, but those were dangerous
days, and a patriot&#8217;s safety rested solely upon
his alertness&mdash;upon his being constantly upon
the outlook for peril. The people seemed to
be friends of Congress, but Tom had grown so
accustomed to assuring himself of everything
that he did not trust them until he had discovered
that which they seemed so anxious
to hide.</p>

<p>The interior of the cabin was dark to one
just coming into it; so Tom stood in the doorway,
his sabre still in his hand, peering about,
and waiting for his eyes to become accustomed
to the darkness. Suddenly he was startled by
a quiet voice saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand as you are. A movement will be
dangerous, my friend, and a sound equally
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was surprised; for the moment he
could see nothing; then he began to make
out, but dimly, a couch of furs and pine
boughs in a corner; a man lay upon this&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
man who had lifted himself up upon one
elbow and held a pistol in his hand. The
gray of twilight had deepened in the swamp
and the dim light that came through the
open doorway was not sufficient to enable the
man upon the couch to see Tom&#8217;s face clearly;
then, too, the latter was standing with his
back to the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have succeeded in ferreting me out,
I see,&#8221; said the man upon the couch. &#8220;But
you have not taken me yet, remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded Tom, his hand
clutching, instinctively, the tighter upon the
hilt of his sabre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pretend ignorance,&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;You have set a price upon my head&mdash;or at
least your masters have&mdash;the butcher Tarleton
and Sir Henry Clinton.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this Tom pressed forward a step; but
the voice rang warningly through the room,
causing him to halt instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you are!&#8221; said the man, sharply.
&#8220;It is not wise to approach a cornered man.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;Whoever you are,&#8221; said Tom, eagerly, &#8220;if
you are an enemy of the British you are a
friend of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came an exclamation from the man
upon the couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I made a mistake,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Surely
I heard the sounds of fighting outside. If you
are one of us that means that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The British have been beaten,&#8221; said Tom,
finishing the sentence for him. &#8220;There were
only four of them; two troopers have been
wounded, another and Colonel Tarleton are
prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tarleton!&#8221; The man upon the couch, in
his excitement attempted to spring out upon
the floor, but sank back with a groan. &#8220;I
had forgotten; you see my leg is broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Nat Collins, the elder of the two
brothers, entered; he seemed angry at Tom
for having entered the cabin, and there was
an anxious look about him, as he stood gazing
from one to the other, not knowing just how
to act.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;Light a candle, Nat,&#8221; said the man upon
the couch. &#8220;And why,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;did
you not tell me that friends had arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did not come until the fight had
started,&#8221; said Nat, lighting a candle in a brass
sconce from a dim fire that burned on the
hearth. The flickering light fell upon Tom&#8217;s
face as the young wood-cutter arose, and the
man on the couch uttered an exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom Deering!&#8221; cried he.</p>

<p>Tom gave him one quick look and then
springing forward, he seized his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Marion,&#8221; he burst out joyfully.
&#8220;Who would ever have thought of seeing
you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, myself, some little time ago,&#8221;
said the soldier. &#8220;How is it with you, my
lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom had been of great service to Major
Marion in his expeditions against the Tories
after the defeat of Sir Peter Parker&#8217;s fleet at
Sullivan&#8217;s Island; the two had gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
come to admire and trust one another
greatly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my good horse,&#8221; answered the boy,
&#8220;and I have a brace of pistols and a sabre;
and, yes, there&#8217;s Cole, too; but that&#8217;s all; the
British have all the rest,&#8221; sadly&mdash;&#8220;house,
slaves, plantation and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, I have been told, is the case with all
the men in Charleston who had the courage
to brave the king,&#8221; said Marion. &#8220;But I can
say nothing from my own observation, Tom,
for I broke my leg about the time Clinton
arrived in the roadstead; and since the fort
fell I&#8217;ve been hiding in the cane-brakes like a
fox; yes, and listening to the hounds in full
cry all around me. But don&#8217;t despair, my
boy; Carolina is not yet beaten; she has only
begun to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they talked there in the dimly-lighted
room, the elder Collins limped in. Marion&#8217;s
quick eye at once noticed that he had been
wounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been hit,&#8221; said he, anxiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;Nothing to speak of, major,&#8221; said the
man. &#8220;It bled pretty freely and it pains a
great deal, but it won&#8217;t last long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Collins followed her husband
into the room. &#8220;What are you going to do
with that British officer?&#8221; inquired she.
&#8220;He&#8217;s going on something dreadful out
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have him brought in,&#8221; said Marion to
Tom. &#8220;I want to see this ruthless king&#8217;s
officer before we let him go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him go!&#8221; ejaculated the Collinses in
a breath. &#8220;You are not going to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are hardly in a position to take prisoners
of war,&#8221; said Major Marion with a
smile. &#8220;We cannot resort to his own measures
and use the rope, either. But bring
him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton
stood within the cabin, and his wounded
troopers were lying groaning upon the floor
near by. He looked with lowering brow upon
Major Marion, his harsh, brutal face made all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the more ruffianly by the rage which distorted
it. Marion lay stretched upon his
couch of furs and pine boughs, his deep-set,
brilliant black eyes seeming to search into
the very soul of his enemy. Tarleton bore
the look for a time, then burst out in a
voice thick with the rage that consumed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are that skulking fox, Marion,
for whom we have been looking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; returned the little man, &#8220;are
that hound, Tarleton, whom I have been trying
to avoid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; burst out Tarleton, who like
a great many others of his sort, did not like
to be paid in his own coin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; I shall endeavor to,&#8221; returned
Marion, coolly. &#8220;It was my desire to
see you; for, Colonel Tarleton, I think the
day is coming when we shall meet quite often
in the persons of our followers; and it is as
well for me to know you by sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you all to know me,&#8221; swore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
fiery Tarleton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make the Carolinas
dread my very name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is your ambition, it is realized
already. The mothers along the Santee
frighten their children into quiet by telling
them that the bloody Tarleton is coming.
The reputation, my dear colonel, is not a very
noble one; but such as it is you have realized
it; and as you seem to like it I wish you great
enjoyment of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The quiet, biting words of Marion made
the burly colonel writhe; he answered in his
loud, harsh fashion, but it was like matching
a bludgeon against a rapier, and he got all
the worst of the contest of tongues. And
while they talked Tom Deering and Cole,
assisted by the two Collins boys, were not
idle. The mounts of the three dragoons were
led up; a rude sling was quickly constructed
and placed between two of them for Marion.
After the attacks of Tarleton, the little partisan
would not be safe in this place when the
defeated troopers and their colonel reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
their own camp. It was Marion himself who
had told Tom what to do, for none knew the
danger better than he.</p>

<p>When all was ready Cole took the slight
form of the major in his mighty arms and
bore him out to where the sling was awaiting
him. There were horses enough to mount
all, Mrs. Collins included. They were
brought up to the door; Mr. Collins and his
wife were assisted to their saddles, and then
the three youths and Cole closed and fastened
the cabin securely, with Tarleton and his men
still inside. The language of the British officer
startled Tom; but Marion had dealt
with such people before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bid you good-night, Colonel Tarleton,&#8221;
he called as he rested his injured leg in the
easy depths of the sling. &#8220;And you may
save your compliments; for when I extend
you mine it will be on a sword blade or the
barrel of a rifle. Now then,&#8221; turning to Tom,
&#8220;if we are ready, forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>And away they went, along the narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
paths of the swamp, amidst the darkness of
the southern night, under the cottonwoods
and palmettos; and this little party was the
nucleus of Marion&#8217;s Brigade, that band of patriots
which was a constant thorn in the side
of Lord Rawdon; that shadowy, evasive,
swift striking brigade whose glory shall live
while there is a true heart that remembers.</p>

<p>The toil of the march and the dangers were
as nothing to Tom Deering; but his spirit was
heavy within him, and as they penetrated
further and further into the interior it grew
heavier still. For each step was taking him
further away from his father&mdash;the good, kind
father whom, sleeping or waking, he never
forgot, and who was now lying with heavy
irons upon his limbs in some noisome prison
pen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>HOW FRANCIS MARION HEARD GOOD NEWS FROM
WILLIAMSBURG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> weeks the little band pressed on
through swamps and over stony roads. The
Baron De Kalb, with a force of Continentals
from Virginia, was marching south, and it
was upon falling in with this army that
Marion based his hope of safety. For it had
not been long before the alarm was out; the
swift, merciless dragoons of Tarleton and the
skulking loyalists were after them night and
day. How they escaped, they themselves
could not afterward remember; the bay of
dogs, upon their trail at night, would often
startle them into renewed flight; the warning
of a friend, or perhaps a slave, would
cause them frequently to change their course
by day.</p>

<p>Marion&#8217;s injured limb grew slowly better;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
at last he was able to dispense with the sling
and ride in the usual fashion. After this
they made much better progress and pushed
northward rapidly. Mrs. Collins was left at a
small town with some relatives; the band was
augmented from time to time during this
flight until at last it numbered some twenty
hardened, bronzed men and boys, well-mounted,
but poorly armed and clothed.</p>

<p>Tom and Cole were scouting one afternoon;
it was dark when they rejoined their comrades,
who had encamped on the banks of a
small stream. Marion, almost entirely well
now, sat by the camp-fire cleaning his pistols
when Tom threw himself from his tired horse
and approached him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What news on the scout, lad?&#8221; asked the
commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;A change has been made in the force
which we are anxious to meet,&#8221; replied the
boy. &#8220;General Gates has superseded De
Kalb and is pushing south by forced marches.
It is his intention, I hear, to carry the war to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the enemy instead of waiting for him to
attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion received the intelligence with
moody brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gates,&#8221; said he, slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of
him. A hot-blooded, impetuous officer.
Brave, but rash; and not at all the man for
the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You, too, think he should avoid a meeting
until compelled to fight, do you, major?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should avoid a meeting until he
knows his ground and is acquainted with
the force before him. There is nothing to be
gained by venturesome enterprises such as, I
dare say, General Gates will attempt. It will
but weaken him and unnerve his rank and file.
De Kalb would have been a better man; he is
accustomed to the warfare of petty European
principalities, which is conducted with caution
and no waste of men or supplies. I am sorry
to hear this; the appointment of Gates was a
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fears for the reckless courage of Gates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
expressed by Marion were only too well
founded. That hot-tempered officer came
plunging through North Carolina, full-tilt,
with the ambition, seemingly, like C&aelig;sar to
write a dispatch announcing in the same
breath the sight of and the conquest of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The army commanded by General Gates,
though small, was the best-equipped that the
south had yet seen; they were well-clad in
smart uniforms; their musket-barrels shone
in the sun; their camp had all the neatness
of a camp of trained soldiery; their artillery
was heavy and capable of excellent service.
Despite his rapid marches, Gates had the
knack of keeping his men in good condition,
and on the evening when Marion, with Tom
Deering and Cole riding upon either side of
him, and his nondescript band of woodsmen
and fugitive militia at his heels, rode into it, the
Continental camp was at its neatest and trimmest.
The coonskin caps and wretched rags
of the newcomers excited the jeers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
smart regular troops as their owners went
down the road, between the line of camp-fires,
toward the general&#8217;s tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this is the sort of reinforcement South
Carolina has to offer us,&#8221; cried a big sergeant
of Virginia foot, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to do their share
of the fighting, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Deering could not stand the laugh of
contempt that greeted this, but reined up
beside a company of the jeering infantry and
allowed his comrades to trot by behind the
unruffled Marion.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you men of Virginia go as far as we of
Carolina for the cause,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ll go to
the mouth of the British cannon, and a little
further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well crowed, my bantam-cock,&#8221; laughed
the big sergeant. &#8220;And how long have you
been soldiering, may I ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s eyes flashed as he faced the circle
of laughing infantrymen who had gathered
about him at the prospect of sport; their
laughter angered him, for he felt that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
uncalled-for and unjust. So he swept the big
sergeant scornfully with his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was soldiering,&#8221; said he, &#8220;before you
had pulled on that nice, clean uniform for
the first time. I had served a gun at Fort
Moultrie and been under fire in a score of
other places, sergeant, while you were still
driving bullocks in the Virginia hay-fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a fact well known to his comrades
that the sergeant had, up to this time, never
smelled gun-powder in actual battle; and
when Tom finished speaking a roar of laughter
went, directed at the big man; and he
reddened angrily, and bit at his huge
mustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never judge a dog by the color of his
fur,&#8221; said Tom, delighted to have turned the
laugh upon the other. &#8220;And never judge a
man by the coat upon his back. When you,
sergeant, have raced through an enemy&#8217;s
country&mdash;a country, too, full of swamps,
thickets and almost impassable roads, for
months, with bloodhounds upon your track<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
by night and Tories with ropes ready in their
hands searching for you by day, you will not
look so trim and natty as you do now, and
you will not be so ready to laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The troops of General Gates were a rough,
good-humored lot; it required but a moment
for them to catch the truth of the boy&#8217;s remarks;
and with one accord, the sergeant
included, they burst into a cheer for the
sincerity and heartiness of which there could
be no doubt. Tom&#8217;s eyes gleamed with satisfaction
as he waved his cap in response,
wheeled his horse and dashed after his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is good stuff in them, for all their
readiness to jeer,&#8221; he muttered to himself.
&#8220;And they are big, strong, willing looking
fellows, too; and should render an excellent
account of themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion&#8217;s men were halted in the road not
far from the headquarters of General Gates.
The latter and Marion were standing at the
flap of the tent conversing earnestly. Beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the stalwart general of the Continentals Marion
looked insignificant; and Gates, like his men,
seemed to regard the partisan&#8217;s command as
a rabble, the like of which clings to the skirts
of every army. His face wore an amused
smile, not unmixed with contempt. It is a
fact that this officer was a vain man, of ostentatious
habit and one whose judgment was
very apt to be affected by parade and the
external show of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very thankful to you, Major Marion,
for coming to put your company at my
service,&#8221; said General Gates, patronizingly.
&#8220;But, the fact is, I have no very great opinion
of cavalry, and think I have but little need
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion flushed with resentment at this;
but controlled himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very thinly settled country,
general,&#8221; returned he. &#8220;I should think
that an active troop of horse would be very
useful both in securing intelligence and in
procuring supplies.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Gates seemed somewhat impressed by this,
and after some further conversation, invited
Marion into his tent. The troop of swamp-riders
dismounted and picketed their horses
outside the camp, preparing to settle for the
night. The very rags and poverty of this
little band which was afterward to become
so famous were but proofs of their integrity,
could Gates but have seen it in that light. It
was in defiance of the temptations and the
power of the British that these men had
taken the field, and had the leader of the
Continentals been a wise man, he would have
seen, even through their rags and destitution,
the steady glow of patriotism; which enkindled
throughout the state by this little, dark, unassuming
officer, and Sumpter, and a few
others of equal daring, was to blaze out, at
last, in that perfect brightness which was to
cause the invader to slink away, confounded.</p>

<p>That night and the two following Marion
and his men spent in the camp of General
Gates. In spite of the bad impression which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
his tattered command had made upon the
general, Marion&#8217;s undoubted knowledge of the
surrounding country was noted and made use
of. But Tom could not bear the camp or its
people and spent but little time there; for he
and Cole were constantly scouting over the
flats and through the woods, at his leader&#8217;s
orders, in the hope of catching a view of the
foe.</p>

<p>The town of Williamsburg was not a great
many miles away, and upon the evening of
the first day Tom and his faithful follower
rode into the town to see what news there was
to be had. The town was a hotbed of patriotism;
the very name of King George was
execrated there, and the boy was sure to be
welcomed and to receive what tidings of the
British the townspeople possessed. As it happened,
a few weeks before this, a party of
British and Tories had entered the place and
plundered right and left; a few who resisted,
and some others whom the Tories pointed out
as rebels, were shot; then the marauders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
rode off with the warning to Williamsburg to
improve in her loyalty to king and parliament
or she would receive another visit.</p>

<p>The citizens gathered in angry crowds.
&#8220;If,&#8221; said they, &#8220;we are to be set upon when
we have not struck a blow against the crown,
what worse can happen to us if we take up
arms and fight like men should against
tyranny.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer to this argument, so
the Williamsburgers proceeded to arm themselves
with whatever they could find in the
way of weapons, and set about drilling upon
the village green. It was in the midst of the
drill that Tom and Cole found them that
evening when they rode down the main
street, and very proud the townsfolk seemed
to be of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell General Gates,&#8221; said the stout old
burgess to Tom, after finding out where he
was from, &#8220;that the freemen of Williamsburg
are preparing. Let the British make another
of their ruffian raids upon the town, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
shall not be like the last. This time, instead
of cautious words, they will be greeted by a
sleet of lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; rang lustily from the ranks of
the militia. &#8220;That they will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them show so much as their noses in
the town limits again and we&#8217;ll send them
back to Cornwallis as soundly beaten as ever
a pack of prowling curs were yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was a brawny, sooty man, in a
blacksmith&#8217;s apron; he carried a great sledge
over his shoulder instead of a musket, and
seemed in every way capable of doing his
part in carrying out the promise. His words
were greeted by much laughter and cheers by
his comrades, and under cover of this Tom
was drawn aside by the stout burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are rare good lads, all of them,&#8221;
spoke the burgess. &#8220;They will fight for
their rights and their firesides to the last, but
they have no one to lead them in whom they
have confidence; it is a great pity, but it
is so.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">
<i>&#8220;THEY ARE RARE GOOD LADS, ALL OF THEM,&#8221;<br />
SPOKE THE BURGESS</i></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>He shook his head despondently as he said
this, and as his eyes traveled along the not
very trim ranks of the volunteers, he shook
his gray head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no man of experience among
them?&#8221; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one, not one,&#8221; answered the burgess,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s a great pity, for they are a fine body
of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head once more and sighed
regretfully. Then turning to Tom he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent a messenger to Governor Rutledge
asking him to select a leader for this company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was his answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said that there was but one man in the
entire South whom he would name as an ideal
leader of irregular troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that man was&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One Francis Marion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom started in surprise and then laughed
with pleasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he to the stout old burgess,
&#8220;why do you not secure him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not to be found. The governor has
no idea if he be living or dead. Men die suddenly
in these times, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;that I could
tell you where to find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man grasped him eagerly by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not jesting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least. I am of Major Marion&#8217;s
command. He is now in the camp of General
Gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>The burgess was overjoyed at this intelligence;
he wrung Tom&#8217;s hand warmly.
&#8220;Good news,&#8221; he cackled, hardly able to
restrain himself. &#8220;I will go to him in the
morning&mdash;I will offer him the command.&#8221;
Then he paused suddenly and continued in a
more sober tone. &#8220;Do you think, my lad,
that he will be inclined to accept?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom thought of his commander&#8217;s cold
reception at the hands of General Gates, and
answered promptly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;I rather think he will, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good&mdash;good!&#8221; The old fellow went off,
at this point, into a rapture of chuckling.
&#8220;Come, you will lodge with me to-night; I
will not accept a refusal. Wait until I give
word to dismiss the company for the day;
then you shall have as fine a supper and as
soft a bed as you have ever had in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the burgess&#8217; command the drill-sergeant
dismissed the militia; then Tom and Cole
were led away to the comfortable stone house
of the town official; their horses were put up
in the stable and baited with corn; Cole was
taken in hand by some of the negro servants,
while his young master was borne off to be
introduced to the family of the burgess. In
spite of his worn clothes and unkempt appearance,
the boy was kindly welcomed by
his hostess and her blooming daughters. To
be sure he noticed, now and then, that the
girls would giggle together, aside, over his
deerskin hunting-shirt or his leather leggings;
but they made up for this by their many little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
kindnesses; and the sly looks of admiration
which they stole at his handsome, sun-browned
face and tall, sinewy form often
made his cheeks burn.</p>

<p>The burgess was as good as his word; the
supper which Tom sat down to was the best
he had eaten for many a long week; and the
bed upon which he stretched his tired length
afterward, being the first he had slept in
since leaving home, felt fully up to specifications.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the household was
astir; and when Tom and the master of the
house had breakfasted they bid the ladies
good-bye. The chestnut and the bay were
ready saddled at the door; and beside them
stood a fat, white horse which was to bear
the weight of the worthy burgess.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not very speedy,&#8221; admitted the official,
&#8220;but he is strong and safe. And that
last quality, young sir, is not a thing to be
overlooked when one comes to my age, and
attains my girth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>The ladies waved their kerchiefs from the
windows; the burgess and the young swamp-rider
took off their caps and bowed in return,
while Cole grinned like an amiable Goliath.
Then they shook their reins, and set off for
the Continental camp, to bear the good tidings
to Marion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>HOW TOM DEERING FOUGHT WITH GATES
AT CAMDEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Needless</span> to say, Marion received the news
of Williamsburg&#8217;s offer with great satisfaction;
it was a relief to him to secure a command
of his own, and he made ready to set
off with his tattered horsemen, to assume
control. With this new body came the commission
of colonel, after a few days, from
Governor Rutledge.</p>

<p>When his small company were ready to
leave the camp of Gates, that officer gave
Marion strict instructions as to the best means
of rendering him service. The fancy of Gates
already beheld the squadrons of Cornwallis
in full flight; and it is a fact that his greatest
solicitude at this time seems to have been
how to secure his captives.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you march south, colonel,&#8221; said he to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Marion, &#8220;I want you to make it your special
duty to destroy all the scows, boats, ferry-flats
and barges on your route. The enemy
must be deprived of the means of escaping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; returned Marion, &#8220;I will do
all I can in this or any other line, general, to
aid you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But afterward he remarked to Tom, who
was his trusted confidant:</p>

<p>&#8220;He never seems to have heard of the barnyard
proverb, &#8216;Don&#8217;t count your chickens before
they are hatched.&#8217; In his fancy he has
met the British and routed them on every
hand. It promises badly for the army, my
lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we do nothing, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not. General Gates is not the man
to tolerate interference. If he were more
open to advice he would be a much safer
leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the departure of Marion the better
genius of Gates left him. The British, under
Lords Rawdon and Cornwallis, were in possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of Camden, a small town upon the
east bank of the Wateree; and Gates conceived
the idea of surprising them. On the
night of the 15th of August he left his camp
at Rugely&#8217;s Mills and advanced toward Camden.
Upon the same night the British made
a move to surprise Gates; so, almost before
they knew it, the vanguards of the two
armies met in the darkness near a small
stream of water known as Sanders Creek.</p>

<p>Before breaking his camp Gates had sent to
Marion for a few horsemen who knew the
country; and Marion had sent Tom and Cole
to lend what aid they could. These two were
in the advance guard of the American army
when it encountered that of the British.
Tom&#8217;s big chestnut horse Sultan, up to his
knees in the waters of Sanders Creek, was the
first to note the approach of the enemy; he
cocked his ears, threw up his head and
snorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, boy?&#8221; said Tom, his eyes running
over the ground before him as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the darkness would permit. As though in
answer there came a scattering of rifle-shots
and a &#8220;pinging&#8221; of the leaden messengers
about his ears.</p>

<p>He wheeled and rode back to the banks.
Saluting the captain in command, he reported:</p>

<p>&#8220;The enemy, sir, seem to be on the other
side of the creek.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain was inexperienced and very
nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;What force is there?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could not make out, sir, because of the
darkness. Shall I cross and try to find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think it safe,&#8221; said the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;That it is necessary is enough for me,&#8221;
returned Tom, proudly.</p>

<p>He spurred Sultan into the water once
more, and under cover of the night crossed
the stream. A long line of British cavalry
was stretched directly in front; they had, undoubtedly,
sent word back to their main body
and were now waiting for orders. Tom dismounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and took a long observation of the
foe&#8217;s position; when at last he remounted
and crossed the creek once more, he found
that General Gates himself had ridden forward
and was anxiously awaiting his report.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their advance is stretched all along the
stream, sir,&#8221; said the lad, saluting. &#8220;And
from indications their main body is coming
up rapidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hasty inspection of the ground caused
Gates to order his force to fall back upon
some plantations in their rear; the British, not
at all sure of what was awaiting them, did
not cross the creek; and thus the two armies
lay upon their weapons waiting for daybreak.
At the first graying of the eastern heavens
the British were forming to advance, and the
Americans were rapidly making ready to receive
them. If there was any advantage it
was in favor of Cornwallis. His force was
composed of veterans, who would be cool under
most exigencies, while Gates&#8217; army was, for
the greater part, made up of raw volunteers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The First Maryland division, including the
Delawares under De Kalb, were posted on the
right; the Virginia militia were on the left;
the North Carolinians, led by the gallant Caswell
were in the center, while the artillery, in
battery, was in the road. Such was the formation
of the American line; both wings
rested upon morasses; the Second Maryland
brigade was posted as a reserve a few hundred
yards in the rear of the first.</p>

<p>The battle began with the advance of the
American left&mdash;the Virginians, under Stevens.
A galling rifle fire was suddenly poured into
them; struck by sudden panic they turned
and fled, many of them not having even discharged
their pieces. This wretched example
was followed by the North Carolina division
in the centre, with the exception of a single
corps commanded by Major Dixon. The
small body of cavalry, under Armond, a
foreign adventurer, broke at the same moment.</p>

<p>Tom Deering had been detained by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
commander to carry messages and orders to
different parts of the field; he saw the rout,
and with sinking heart he strove to rally the
fleeing militia, riding among them, waving
his sabre and shouting desperately for them
to stand and reform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you cowards to run at the first fire?&#8221;
he shouted. &#8220;Rally, men; strike a blow for
freedom and your native state.&#8221;</p>

<p>For very shame some of the fugitives
halted, and Tom began rapidly reforming
them. But, just then, the British cavalry
plunged forward, and the hope of staying the
panic was gone forever. The devoted Continentals&mdash;Maryland
and Delaware troops,
all trained soldiers&mdash;bore the brunt of the
action. De Kalb was at their head, for Gates
had ridden away to the rear in the desperate
hope of rallying the militia; the artillery was
in the hands of the enemy, and the regulars
who continued to stand fast numbered but
nine hundred, as opposed to two thousand of
the best troops in the British service.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>But these stout hearts, undismayed by the
flight of their comrades, not only resisted the
attack of the enemy, but actually carried the
bayonet into their ranks. The combatants
rushed and reeled with locked weapons; but
the struggle could not last, for when the
British cavalry returned from pursuing the
fugitives their sabres gave the finishing stroke
to the affair. The heroic De Kalb fell,
pierced by fourteen wounds, and at the fall
of their leader the rank and file broke and
fled from the field, leaving everything behind
them.</p>

<p>When darkness closed in once more it
found General Gates, with a shattered remnant
of his once formidable force, flying
along the roads toward North Carolina. As
for Tom Deering, he was on his way through
the swamps to rejoin Marion, his eyes full of
unshed tears and his heart full of the bitterness
that comes with defeat.</p>

<small>HOW TOM BRAVED THE TORIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Cole!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>A movement of the giant slave&#8217;s eyes
showed that he heard. He and his young
master had dismounted upon the edge of a
clump of woods and were carefully surveying
a large brick mansion that stood in the midst
of a well-kept park.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the looks of things,&#8221; said the
young swamp-rider. &#8220;There are strangers in
Mr. Foster&#8217;s mansion, Cole, and we had better
be sure of who they are before we venture
into the open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole signified his entire approval of this
course; so they tied their horses well among
the trees and then crawled back to the verge
of the wood once more.</p>

<p>Some months had passed since the defeat of
Gates; Colonel Marion had now begun to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
make himself felt in the struggle, and his
sudden ambuscades and unlooked-for onslaughts
had made his name a terror to
British soldier and Tory alike. Not a little
of the credit of all this was due to the
devotion to duty shown by Tom Deering and
his faithful slave. The hoof-marks of Sultan
and Cole&#8217;s bay charger, Dando, were imprinted
upon every mile of territory between
the North Edisto River and the Little Peedee.
The courses of the Congaree and the Wateree
were as familiar to them as though there were
not a fresh danger lurking in every turn they
made.</p>

<p>They had the hardihood to even penetrate
the region about Orangeburg and Ninety-Six
in search of information as to the enemy&#8217;s
movements; and the news which they gathered
frequently led to disaster for the British
in the shape of a severe loss of supplies, or the
destruction of a flying column proceeding
upon a raid.</p>

<p>While Tom Deering was willing to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
any risks and dare any peril to serve his
country, still it is doubtful if he would have
been so eager, so tireless in his efforts if it
had not been that the thought of his father
goaded him on. He knew that until the
Americans retook Charleston there would be
little chance of his being able to rescue the
prisoner; and so he was willing to take his
life in his hands at any hour of the day or
night in the hope that by so doing he might
hasten the hour.</p>

<p>In his excursions Tom had discovered
many things of a surprising nature. One of
these was the fact that there were still some
of the partisans of congress who were, as yet,
in possession of their estates. As a rule these
were very rich and very cautious men; and
one of them was Mr. Foster, who owned and
cultivated great stretches of land between
the Congaree and Columbia. This rich
planter had from time to time provided the
young scout with valuable information. It was
a search for this very desirable requisite of intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
warfare that brought our two friends
upon the edge of the Foster plantation to-day.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the appearance of the horses,&#8221; said
Tom, &#8220;the visitors are not soldiers. It may
be some of our own brigade, Cole.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the black gestured his doubt of this.
Through long practice he had become master
of a sort of sign language, and could readily
communicate his thoughts to his young
master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tories,&#8221; signaled Cole.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;they would not dare
disturb Mr. Foster. Why, Cornwallis himself
has not deemed it wise to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tories,&#8221; signaled Cole, once more, and
this time very positively. &#8220;Tories will do
anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right in one way, Cole,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;There is not much of a blackguardly or
bloody nature that they have left undone, in
this section at least. But, all the same, in
this case I think you&#8217;re wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>But Cole remained obdurate; he seemed
most unwilling to change his views. They
were still discussing the situation, Tom in
low, guarded tones and Cole in his not very
deft sign language, when suddenly there came
a strange, smothered sound from overhead,
followed by a crashing of a heavy body
through the boughs of a tree, and a man,
with a cry of fear upon his lips, tumbled to
the ground at their feet.</p>

<p>Like a flash Cole had produced his heavy
pistol and presented it at the man&#8217;s head;
but Tom pushed it quickly aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Dogberry,&#8221; said he, quietly. &#8220;Put
up your weapon, Cole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole glanced at the newcomer, and then a
broad grin of recognition spread across his
face. It was a negro slave belonging to the
Foster place, and he lay flat upon his back,
staring at them with great, round eyes, while
an expression of mingled fear, amazement and
doubt rested upon his ebony countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dogberry,&#8221; said Tom, laughing at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the negro&#8217;s remarkable entrance on the scene.
&#8220;Suppose you tell us all about this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mars Tom,&#8221; said Dogberry, sitting up, &#8220;is
dis you, sah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is. And here&#8217;s Cole, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lawsee! I done gone &#8217;most broke my
black head!&#8221; Dogberry stared up into the
tree. &#8220;Just look how far I fall, Mars Tom.
Just you look up there, sah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How came you up in the tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mars Foster put me there, sah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Foster. Impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed he did, Mars Tom. I&#8217;se telling
you de plain truth. He put me up there
when de Tory white men comes along to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tories!&#8221; exclaimed Tom. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They am up at de house, sah, at dis moment.
And they am carrying on scand&#8217;lus
with de fambly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what were you sent into the tree
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To watch for you, sah. Mars Foster sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
of thought you&#8217;d be along dis way to-day,
Mars Tom; and I was told to climb up in de
tree and watch for you, and not let you go up
to de house, and get cotched by de Tories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Foster.&#8221; Tom waved one
hand in the direction of the planter&#8217;s mansion.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember that of you, and will
return the favor some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole began to make rapid passes and signs
to Dogberry; the latter, at the best, was much
in dread of the giant dumb-slave, but just
now Cole&#8217;s earnestness made him very terrible
in the other&#8217;s eyes, indeed. Cole was asking
how Dogberry, if he was watching in the tree,
failed to note their approach and neglected
to make his presence known to them. Very
much frightened at Cole&#8217;s gestures, Dogberry
clung to Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let dat nigger harm me, Mars Tom.
Look at dar! He&#8217;s making a sign dat he&#8217;ll
frow me over de fence!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this Cole burst into a gale of laughter;
and then Tom explained.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;He wants to know why I was in de tree
and didn&#8217;t make no sound?&#8221; Dogberry
looked exceedingly foolish, and then continued:
&#8220;De plain truth, Mars Tom, is dat
dis nigger done gone went to sleep, and didn&#8217;t
wake till a great big yaller-tailed hornet come
along and stung him on de nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That accounts for your sudden arrival,
then,&#8221; smiled the young partisan. &#8220;But, tell
me, Dogberry, how many Tories are at your
master&#8217;s place?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dogberry&#8217;s knowledge of numbers was exceedingly
limited; so he slowly and laboriously
counted nine upon his fingers and held
them up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just dis many, sah, and dey am having
dreadful carryings on. De ladies of de fambly
is most frightened out of dey wits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine, eh!&#8221; Tom looked reflectively at
Cole and the giant held out his great arms
and smiled. There were none too many in
his estimation. But his master was doubtful.
Tom had partaken of Marion&#8217;s caution; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
had seen so much of the Swamp-Fox&#8217;s success
based upon mere carefulness, that he began to
give caution a place beside courage in the list
of qualities necessary to a soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are they armed?&#8221; he asked the
negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey have swords, sah, like yours; and
dey have guns&mdash;one apiece, for I counted
dem. I see dem standing on de lawn under
de apple tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the lawn under the apple tree!&#8221; repeated
Tom, his eyes lighting. &#8220;Are you
sure of that, Dogberry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sah. Dat&#8217;s where I saw &#8217;em put
dere guns. And I s&#8217;pose dey&#8217;s there still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lawn has no windows overlooking it
from the ground floor, Cole,&#8221; said Tom slowly.
&#8220;If we could get those guns we might make
an important capture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly Cole began to signal to be allowed
to try to secure them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;we must be sure that
things are as stated. Dogberry may be mistaken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
or he may have forgotten something.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this Dogberry&#8217;s eyes grew large and
bright with sudden recollection. &#8220;Dar, now!&#8221;
ejaculated he, &#8220;I did forgot something, sah.
When dem Tories come up to de place dey
have some prisoners wif dem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sah. And dey&#8217;s locked up in de
barn at this minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Dogberry, you may return to
the house. Try and get word to Mr. Foster
that you have seen us; but be careful and
don&#8217;t let the Tories hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sah; &#8217;deed I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll be careful,
sah.&#8221; Dogberry slowly made his way through
the woods until he reached the main road;
then he approached the house carelessly as
though, possibly, just coming back from his
work on some distant part of the plantation.</p>

<p>Cole and Tom formed their plans instantly.
They must release the prisoners, and if possible
they must secure what ammunition the Tories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
possessed, for Marion was so badly in need
of it that even a few rounds would be
welcome. It was well known that the Tories
were always well supplied with powder and
shot; the king furnished it to them, not grudgingly
as he did to his regular troops, but
freely; and they used it in a corresponding
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage to get the rifles out of their
reach,&#8221; said Tom to Cole. &#8220;You slip around
to the barn and see if you can liberate the
men. If there is a guard over them, which
most likely there will be, dispose of him
quietly. I need not tell you to avoid unnecessary
bloodshed, for I know that you
will do that, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole nodded his understanding of his
master&#8217;s instructions and moved softly away;
but in a moment he turned and came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Tom, in surprise.</p>

<p>Cole held out his hand; the gesture was
more eloquent than any words could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
been; it spoke of the friendship and love that
existed between master and man, of the
affection that began in childhood and would
only end in death. Tom&#8217;s eyes filled with
tears; he grasped the outstretched hand
tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Cole,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for not thinking
of it first. We are going into danger, and
either of us, or both, may not come out of it
alive. If this should prove the case: good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they separated; Cole stole away toward
the back of the house, keeping his huge frame
well concealed behind the tree trunks and
thick bush. The barn was a large structure,
not a great distance from the house, and as
he came in view of the big doors Cole saw a
man standing, leaning upon the muzzle of
a rifle and staring toward the mansion.</p>

<p>Tom set about his work as cautiously as the
slave; he crept along behind the bush and a
stone fence until he reached a spot almost
directly in line with the old apple tree which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Dogberry had mentioned. It stood almost in
the centre of the lawn; a few rustic seats were
at the foot, for it formed a delightful place for
a rest upon a hot afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there are the Tories&#8217; rifles, sure
enough,&#8221; muttered the lad. &#8220;No one seems
left to watch over them; so I&#8217;d best make the
move quickly, for there will hardly be a
better opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a long, last look about to see that no
one was observing him, Tom broke from
cover and boldly stepped out across the lawn
toward the tree where the guns were standing.
He deemed it best to attempt the thing boldly;
for as it was broad day cunning would be
thrown away. The rifles were of the variety
provided by the king to his loyal subjects in
North America, and were rather heavy. Tom
took up the entire nine, however, having left
his own light fowling-piece behind in the
bush; it was rather a heavy load, but the
lad was strong and toughened by constant outdoor
exercise, so he managed to carry them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
off back along the track by which he had
approached, and concealed them in a safe
place.</p>

<p>Not a sound was to be heard anywhere save
the low, moaning chant of some slaves at
work in a far-off field, and an occasional outburst
of rude laughter from the mansion.
There was no sign of Cole; Tom stole to a
position from which he could view the barn.
He, too, saw the man with a rifle, on guard
before the big door.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man on the watch, as I supposed there
would be,&#8221; muttered the boy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
Cole will be able to approach him unseen.
But, I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, for the guard at the
barn door had moved slightly and afforded a
clearer view of his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Cole!&#8221; breathed Tom, excitedly.
&#8220;Good for him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched for a few moments; but the
colossal negro did not move; he might have
been asleep on his feet, so quietly did he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
stand. A renewed burst of laughter just then
came from the house and drew Tom&#8217;s attention
from him for a moment. When his gaze
returned once more, Cole had vanished!</p>

<p>Tom could not believe his eyes for a moment;
but a second glance proved to him
that the first had been right. There did not
seem to be any place near at hand behind
which Cole could conceal himself; and Tom
was greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; he muttered, after a time spent
in waiting for the great negro to reappear,
&#8220;wherever Cole is he&#8217;ll render a good account
of himself; so I need not worry about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made his way back to the front of the
Foster house. The lawn was still deserted; no
one was in sight, but the boisterous laughter
of the Tories within showed that they were
still carrying through their, apparently, fixed
plan of revelry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get a view of what&#8217;s going on,&#8221;
said the lad to himself. &#8220;Mr. Foster has done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
me many favors and been of great assistance
to General Marion and the cause; so I&#8217;d risk
a great deal to help him in any way that I
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>The more he pondered the matter the more
he felt inclined to approach the house; it was
a daring thing to do, but a scout for the
Swamp-Fox must become accustomed to
daring deeds, and Tom had had his share of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only Cole were here,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;I
would not hesitate a minute. But here goes
anyhow; I&#8217;ll trust to luck, for this once,
though the colonel would be against that sort
of thing if he were here. He says always be
sure of your aim and of what you are about
to strike, before dealing the blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had started for the house while he was
still speaking; as noticed before, there were
no windows overlooking the lawn from the
first floor; so there was no danger of being
overseen in this way; but, still, there was a
wide doorway leading out upon a long veranda;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
some one might come out and discover
him at any moment.</p>

<p>He did not breathe freely until he reached
the shelter of the walls, against which clung
and climbed a thick growth of honeysuckle.
This, at least, would afford a slight concealment;
and he worked his way slowly along
until he was in position to see any one who
came out of the house by the front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good that the vine is thick and rather
loose at the bottom,&#8221; said Tom, drawing the
tendrils about him. &#8220;It would be a ticklish
thing to stand here without any cover at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood there for some little time, debating
as to what his next move should be. He had
concluded that a venture around the corner
of the house would be about the best thing
he could do, when suddenly there came a
sharp metallic click, followed by the sound
of a closing door. Tom&#8217;s heart beat loudly
against his ribs; he peeped through the screen
of vine leaves toward the veranda.</p>

<p>A tall young girl stood there; she was attired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
in white, and her dark eyes were flashing
with resentment; there was a hot flush upon
her cheeks, as she threw out her arms, in a
gesture of anger, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how long is this to last! how long is
it to last! They are brutes to treat my
father so; to be taken prisoner by the enemy
would not be near so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lucy,&#8221; said Tom to himself, as he
recognized Mr. Foster&#8217;s daughter. &#8220;And
something unpleasant is happening, just as
I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were only a man!&#8221; whispered the
girl passionately. &#8220;If I only had brothers,
we should see how long these cowards would
infest my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short, clear whistle by which
Tom attracted the attention of the Foster
household before he ventured into the open
upon his visits. It was a signal well known
to Mr. Foster, Lucy and the more trustworthy
of the slaves; and Tom now placed his fingers
to his lips and whistled the notes softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Lucy started as the sound struck her ear;
with quick steps she came forward to the rail
of the veranda and leaned forward eagerly.
Tom was just about to step from his place of
concealment behind the vines, when the door
opened and closed swiftly, and Mark Harwood
stood upon the veranda at Lucy Foster&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>The girl went pale and caught her breath;
Tom shrank back among the vines, clutching
the pistol which he had taken the precaution
to bring with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Lucy,&#8221; spoke Mark Harwood.</p>

<p>Anger sparkled in the girl&#8217;s eye as he
addressed her; it was clear that she held him
in great aversion. Mark&#8217;s face showed the
same sly, crafty, smiling expression as of
yore; and he rubbed his hands together as he
stood there, exciting in his Cousin Tom&#8217;s
breast an indignant desire to come out and
kick him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you left the room and your
father&#8217;s guests?&#8221; inquired Mark.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;My father&#8217;s guests!&#8221; Lucy turned upon
him a look of scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all your father&#8217;s friends, are they
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are his enemies,&#8221; returned the
girl, &#8220;and well you know it, Mark Harwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear you say that,&#8221; said
Mark, &#8220;because you know that I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I also know you to be his enemy,&#8221; flashed
the young lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy!&#8221; his voice was filled with injured
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t use that tone to me! It does
not deceive me for a moment. You are a
king&#8217;s man&mdash;a Tory&mdash;a spy of Cornwallis.
Even at this moment you are here in the
British general&#8217;s pay, to collect any evidence
that may be injurious to my poor father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, Lucy. You do me an
injustice. It is true that I am loyal to the
king&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and to prove your loyalty you place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
yourself at the head of a band of men who
would be a disgrace to the most barbarous
country; they kill, burn, and destroy the
lives and possessions of inoffensive persons,
and you take pride in it, Mark Harwood;
your boasts have reached my ears, even here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment; the
offensive smile gradually faded from his face
and a bitter look took its place. He saw that
his pretensions did not throw her off her
guard, so he showed his true colors.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have heard of some of my doings,&#8221;
laughed he, savagely. &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t say that
it has affected you greatly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean that your deeds have not
frightened me, you are right. I do not fear
you, Mark Harwood, and I never shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure of that,&#8221; sneered he.
&#8220;Stranger things have happened. This is a
nest of rebels, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s refusal to aid the cause of
the king is proof enough.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; said Lucy, bravely. &#8220;Do not
go too far. Remember that my father has
powerful friends in England&mdash;friends who
will not desert him if he is in need.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose that I don&#8217;t know that?
His influence has been all that saved him a
dozen times or more. But he is a rebel, and
you are a rebel; don&#8217;t deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot speak for my father,&#8221; exclaimed
Lucy, &#8220;but I can for myself. I love liberty
and hate the tyrannies of the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brave girl!&#8221; exclaimed the concealed
Tom, incautiously.</p>

<p>The sound of his voice reached Mark&#8217;s ears,
but not the substance of the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; said the young Tory,
his face paling slightly. But Lucy gazed
steadfastly away and did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you not hear something like a
voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply; he listened for a
moment and then went half-way down the
broad stone steps that led to the veranda, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
looked about searchingly. Tom flattened
himself against the wall of the house; the
thick, odorous runners of the vine hung in a
heavy screen before him, effectually hiding
him from Mark&#8217;s prying eyes. At length the
latter returned to the veranda, but his suspicions
were aroused, and he looked at Lucy
from under his frowning brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear a voice?&#8221; inquired he.</p>

<p>But still she did not answer; he bit his lip
vexedly, then laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when I stood
just inside the door there, before coming out,
I heard voices. Who were you talking to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was talking to myself,&#8221; said Lucy,
truthfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;A likely story,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;However,
if there is any one lurking about here I&#8217;ll beat
him out like a rabbit.&#8221; He turned to the
door and paused with his hand upon the
catch. &#8220;And, by the way, Miss Lucy,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;you need not trouble yourself to
warn your friend the rebel, if there is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
near at hand; for it will do no good. We&#8217;ll
catch him if he were as elusive as the Swamp-Fox,
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the door closed behind him; Lucy
with her breath catching in sobs of fright,
sprang down the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; answered Tom, stepping from his
hiding-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in great danger,&#8221; panted Lucy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard all,&#8221; said the boy, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;They will have no
mercy, if they take you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should expect none in that event.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tramp of feet sounded in the hall, coming
toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming,&#8221; exclaimed the poor,
frightened girl. &#8220;Oh, what will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm yourself. If you look as frightened
as all that they will be assured that they are
upon the scent of something. Be brave;
I know you can do it, Lucy, if you want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was unable to say more before the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
opened. He turned and ran rapidly and
softly until he rounded the corner of the
house at the upper side. A group of fierce,
hectoring men, with sabres belted at their
waists, trooped out at the heels of Mark Harwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;I&#8217;m
pretty sure that there is a skulking rebel concealed
about here somewhere. Scatter, and
run your blades into every bush. We&#8217;ll be
sure to stir him out of his hiding.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tories did as directed, while Lucy
stood watching them from the steps. She
seemed calm enough; but the twitching of
her mouth and the light in her eyes showed
the fear that was almost overwhelming her.
However, she had no cause for immediate
fear, for the very daring of Tom Deering had,
by this time, placed him out of pressing
danger.</p>

<p>Upon the upper side of the house were a
number of long, narrow windows, set with
diamond shaped panes of glass. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
opened from the dining-room; and at the
very first one, upon turning the corner of the
house, the lad saw the black, scared face of
the slave Dogberry, looking down at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; Dogberry stared with all
his might. &#8220;Am dat really you, Mars Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; who&#8217;s there with you, Dogberry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not anybody, sah. They all just now
rush out to cotch you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, Tom Deering
sprang up, caught the ledge of the window
and drew himself up. He had just vanished,
through the window, when the first
Tory rounded the corner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>HOW TOM DEERING HELD THE STAIRCASE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dining-room of the Foster mansion
presented an appearance of great confusion,
and Tom looked about in astonishment. The
furniture was thrown about in much disorder;
some of the costly pictures had been torn from
the walls; others hung askew; valuable bric-&agrave;-brac
was shattered upon the hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has been going on here, Dogberry?&#8221;
asked the young swamp-rider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I told you, Mars Tom, dat dose
gemmen was carrying on scand&#8217;lus. Just
take a look around and see if I ain&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a thin, white-faced man
entered the apartment; he had the appearance
of an invalid, and seemed very much disturbed.
At sight of the boy he started back,
with a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You here!&#8221; he exclaimed, astonished.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Foster,&#8221; quietly, &#8220;I am here.
Pardon my entering without being asked;
but your Tory visitors became a trifle too
pressing outside there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Mr. Foster, &#8220;when shall I rid
myself of them! See what they have done,&#8221;
with a gesture of one thin hand at the ruin
of his precious objects of art; &#8220;wanton vandalism&mdash;without
a shadow of excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cowards!&#8221; broke out Tom, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;They demanded wine,&#8221; said Mr. Foster,
&#8220;well knowing that I never keep it in the
house; and because I was unable to produce
it for their entertainment they proceeded to
destroy whatever their hands fell upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; cried Tom, his voice full of
honest indignation at the outrage and sincere
pity for the frail, white-faced man who could
not resent the wrong done him. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll
see what we can do for these gentry before
the day is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cousin, Mark Harwood, is their
leader,&#8221; said Mr. Foster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Tom reddened with shame at the words.
&#8220;Mr. Foster,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he is a sort of cousin
of mine, it is true; but not a single drop of
the Deering blood flows in his veins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; cried Mr. Foster. &#8220;I had
not intended, my boy, to make you remember
a relationship that must be painful to you at
all times. But,&#8221; looking hurriedly about,
&#8220;we must not forget that you are in a position
of no little peril. If the Tories were to
return and find you here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey am returning, Mars Foster!&#8221; exclaimed
Dogberry, who had left the apartment
as Mr. Foster entered, and now came
posting back, his black face shining with
excitement. &#8220;Dey&#8217;s all on de veranda now,
sah.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom glanced swiftly toward the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Mr. Foster, &#8220;not that;
they may be watching for you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get cover of some kind,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;Do you not hear their footsteps? I shall be
caught like a rat in a trap!&#8221; His glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
traveled rapidly about the room. &#8220;Have
you not a cupboard or some such thing in
which I can conceal myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mr. Foster, in despair. But
suddenly his face lighted up. &#8220;I have it;
the very thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grasping Tom by the arm he threw open a
door. The boy found himself in a wide hallway
at the end of which was a broad steep
flight of stairs leading to the floor above.
Almost at the foot of the staircase was a
large clock whose wooden works made a burring
sound as they moved, and whose great
pendulum ticked loudly, slowly, solemnly.
The clock almost reached from floor to ceiling:
Mr. Foster threw open the painted glass
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is room for you there,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>In a moment Tom was inside the big clock
with the door closed upon him; almost at
the same moment the outer door opened, and
the Tories came stamping noisily into the
hall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there is any one about the
place except those who belong here,&#8221; said one
of them in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I heard a strange voice,&#8221; insisted
Mark Harwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; The owner of the big voice was
a huge man, with massive limbs and the torso
of a giant. As he came down the hall he
grumbled, &#8220;How long are you going to keep
us at this place, anyhow; let&#8217;s put the torch
to it and be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of time for that,&#8221; said Mark.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry,&#8221; growled the big man. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been here,&#8221; he drew out a heavy gold watch,
&#8220;almost three hours,&#8221; he continued, consulting
the timepiece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, your watch is wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong! This watch is never wrong.
But, hold on, let&#8217;s compare it with Master
Foster&#8217;s clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom held his breath as the speaker paused
before the clock.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Hello, the confounded thing has stopped,&#8221;
said the big man. &#8220;Run down, I suppose.
Wait, gentlemen; I&#8217;ll do Foster a favor by
opening his clock and winding it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had his hand upon the catch of the clock
door when Mark Harwood pulled him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the clock,&#8221; said the latter;
&#8220;let us attend to more important matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Foster had re-entered the dining-room
as soon as Tom had hidden himself in the clock
case; therefore he neither saw nor heard what
passed in the hall. The Tories came into the
room, their swords clanking and their spurs
jingling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing for you, Foster,&#8221; growled
the huge man, whose name, by the way, was
Clarage&mdash;a notorious bully and leader of a
body of Major Gainey&#8217;s loyalists&mdash;&#8220;that we
did not find any one lurking about the
grounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could not have done much worse
than you have already done,&#8221; said Mr. Foster,
bitterly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;So you think,&#8221; put in Mark Harwood.
&#8220;But we would have proven you wrong
without loss of time, my dear sir; mind you
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A long rope and a stout limb for the spy,&#8221;
laughed Clarage; &#8220;and not to be any way
mean, Foster, we would have given you a
place beside him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy Foster came in at that moment, and
her eyes filled with renewed resentment as
she heard these words addressed to her invalid
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long, Mr. Clarage,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;is
this to continue? My father is not strong,
as you well know; your ruffianly behavior
is making him ill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is the little rebel,&#8221; laughed Clarage,
in his bull-like tones. Then he turned to
Mark Harwood. &#8220;Do you know, Harwood,
who she reminds me of as she stands there
with her eyes flashing and her little hands
clinched? Why, that cousin of yours&mdash;Laura,
you know. Why man, it seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
me that all the prettiest girls in the colony
are rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Laura will not remain one for any
great length of time,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;And
neither would Miss Lucy, here, for all her
angry looks, under like conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Laura is to be married,&#8221; returned Mark.</p>

<p>Tom Deering, in the tall clock, started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Married, eh?&#8221; said Clarage. &#8220;And when,
pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On next Christmas eve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Lieutenant Cheyne, of Tarleton&#8217;s
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura married! and to the inhuman monster
who had tortured poor Cole! Tom could
not, would not believe it!</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not fancy she&#8217;d consent to wed a
king&#8217;s officer,&#8221; said one of the Tory band.
&#8220;She was always a proud little thing&mdash;a very
spitfire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;ll consent fast enough,&#8221; laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Mark. &#8220;She refused Cheyne, point-blank,
when my father proposed the match; but
before Christmas day comes around, she&#8217;ll
have changed her mind, I&#8217;ll promise you
that. My father is not a man to be balked in
his purpose by a slip of a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he select Cheyne as her husband?&#8221;
asked Clarage, with interest. &#8220;Come,
tell us that; I&#8217;ll warrant there&#8217;s some good
reason for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a good reason for everything
that Jasper Harwood does,&#8221; said the Tory
who had before spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right in that,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;You
see, father is very anxious that the estate of
our rebel relative, Deering, who was taken
in arms against the king, shall not revert to
the crown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good of him,&#8221; said some one. &#8220;But
it is the first time that I knew him to have
any friendly feeling toward Deering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has none. It is not for Deering&#8217;s
sake that my father is anxious, but for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
own. You see, he wants the estate for
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gale of laughter went up at this confession.
Lucy had been urging her father
to go to his chamber, as his face was growing
more drawn and haggard every moment,
showing that the strain was greater than he
cared to admit. At last he consented; she
opened the door leading into the hall and he
passed out, thinking that Lucy was following
him. He paused at the tall clock to speak
an encouraging word to the boy concealed
therein, then looked surprisedly about for
Lucy.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone on up to her room without
waiting for me,&#8221; said he, to himself. Then
with another &#8220;courage, my lad,&#8221; to Tom, he
ascended the staircase.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mark Harwood was explaining,
with evident delight, his father&#8217;s
reasons for marrying Laura to the British
dragoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheyne,&#8221; said he, &#8220;has some very high-class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
connections across the water; an uncle
is the Duke of Shropshire, you know, and
the Marquis of Dorking is a cousin. Both
of these gentlemen are very friendly with the
king and Lord North; so, you see, with the
lieutenant in the family, there is no great
danger of our losing the Deering estate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another shout of laughter greeted this; the
crafty methods of Jasper Harwood seemed to
please the Tories greatly. Suddenly there
came a loud bellowing from Clarage, and the
laughter ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where has Foster gone?&#8221; demanded the
Tory. &#8220;What has become of him? He
was here a moment ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s up to some trick,&#8221; cried Mark Harwood
excitedly. &#8220;There is a Whig spy about,
somewhere; and Foster has gone to warn and
help him to elude us.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an instant rush for the door;
but Lucy Foster stood there barring their
passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father is unwell,&#8221; she said, quietly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
but with a slight tremble in her voice. &#8220;He
has gone to his chamber to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, is it so, indeed,&#8221; sneered young Harwood.
&#8220;Well, we will assure ourselves of
that, Miss Lucy, if you please. Stand aside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not!&#8221; cried she, defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste words with her,&#8221; growled
Clarage. &#8220;There is no knowing what her
rebel father is up to while we are parleying
with her, here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not move!&#8221; exclaimed Lucy, in
ringing tones. &#8220;My father has gone to his
chamber because he is unwell&mdash;I give you my
word for that. Is it not enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harwood. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see for ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not disturb him. It is cruel&mdash;it
is a sin&mdash;for he is weak and ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without any further words the Tories
sprang at her. But at that same instant the
door, against which the brave girl had placed
her back, opened behind her; a strong arm
drew her quickly into the hall; then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
door closed with a snap and the astounded
king&#8217;s men found themselves facing, not a
weak girl, but a tall, muscular youth with a
keen bronzed face, steady, cool eyes, and a
naked sabre in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, his fearless gaze
traveling over them as he stood there, &#8220;I bid
you good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom Deering,&#8221; cried Mark Harwood,
astounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so!&#8221; The young swamp-rider&#8217;s
eyes were filled with scorn as he addressed
himself to his Tory cousin. &#8220;You are surprised
to see me, I take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this fool that places his head in
the lion&#8217;s mouth?&#8221; roared Clarage, his deep
voice sounding like the rumbling of distant
thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t flatter yourself.&#8221; Tom&#8217;s level gaze
met Clarage&#8217;s furious one, with quiet assurance.
&#8220;There are no lions here; it is more like a
nest of rats.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a snarl the big Tory dragged his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
heavy, brass hilted sword from its scabbard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then feel of the rat&#8217;s teeth,&#8221; he growled
drawing back his arm for a tremendous
blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the scout of the Swamp-Fox,&#8221; cried
Mark Harwood. &#8220;Cut him down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom smiled at the eagerness in his cousin&#8217;s
voice, and at his very evident disinclination
to try to put the words into execution upon
his own account. The careful teaching of
Victor St. Mar had not been forgotten; on the
contrary, Tom had not ceased to practice with
small sword and sabre each day of his life;
until, at last, there was not a man in Marion&#8217;s
brigade that could stand before him sword in
hand.</p>

<p>This gave him a feeling of confidence when
Clarage drew back his heavy blade to cut him
down, as Mark Harwood had cried out for him
to do. The Tory had great strength, it was
true, but the lad&#8217;s practiced eye told him that
there was absolutely no skill behind it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;Now, my jackanapes,&#8221; bellowed Clarage,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll nail you against the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy blade cut downward with a
swish. But it was met and deftly turned
aside; and the wielder of it received a sharp,
contemptuous rap upon the side of the head
from the flat of the boy&#8217;s sabre, in return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rats!&#8221; rang out Tom&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Rats, all
of you! Insulters of girls and bullies of old
men! You dare not face one who rides with
Marion. I defy you all!&#8221;</p>

<p>For, at this exhibition of his dexterity with
the blade which he held in his hand, the Tories
had ceased to display any undue eagerness to
come forward. Clarage, indeed, made well
nigh mad with rage, strove to get in a cut;
but the flashing sabre of the swamp-rider
drove him back with ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pistols,&#8221; cried one. &#8220;At him with the
pistols.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in the holsters in the stable,&#8221;
returned another. This was a fact that had
been noted by Tom; the total absence of firearms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
among the Tories was the reason for his,
seemingly, uncalled-for boldness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to let one boy hold us at bay,&#8221;
shouted Clarage, flecks of white foam appearing
upon his lip, so great was his rage. &#8220;At
him, all together! Cut him down!&#8221;</p>

<p>A circle of drawn swords flashed in Tom&#8217;s
eyes; but before they could strike, he had
vanished through the door and clapped it in
their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;After him,&#8221; bawled Clarage, in a hoarse,
thick voice, as he tore the door open and
dashed into the hall. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble yourself, my dear sirs,&#8221;
came a steady, resolute voice from above. In
amaze they glared upward. About midway
on the staircase stood the bold youth who had
so braved their wrath, his sabre point resting
upon the step upon which he stood. &#8220;I have
not the slightest intention of escaping; your
company is too entertaining for me to desire to
leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have him safely,&#8221; said Mark Harwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
in tones of triumph. &#8220;Escape is impossible
now; get the muskets, Fannin,&#8221; to
one of the others, &#8220;we&#8217;ll soon bring him to
his knees.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man shot quickly down the hall and
out at the front door. Tom&#8217;s laugh rang in
the ears of the seven who remained, for he
was thinking of the disappointment that was
in store for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be mad,&#8221; growled Clarage at
this. &#8220;No sane person would laugh at the
prospect of certain death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;You are always
right, except when you imagine you can
handle a sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more his laugh rang out; and before
he had done, the man sent for the firearms
came racing back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rifles are gone,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; they stared at him in consternation.
&#8220;What do you mean, Fannin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; returned the Tory.
&#8220;The rifles have been carried off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;I have taken good care of that,&#8221; cried the
lad on the staircase. &#8220;Your rifles, gentlemen,
are where you will not be able to find them
in a hurry. If you want to take me it must
be hand to hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then hand to hand it shall be,&#8221; roared
Clarage, his face purple with passion. &#8220;Shall
it be said,&#8221; he cried, turning to his companions,
&#8220;that one rebel boy held back and defied
eight loyal subjects of the king?&#8221;</p>

<p>His was the boldest spirit among them, and
now its influence began to be felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; they shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then at him, like men. I only ask you
to follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They took tighter grips upon the hilts of
their swords. There was a window at the
head of the staircase and a landing just under
it. A broad beam of sunlight streamed
through the window and bathed the staircase
and the boy upon it in a flood of golden
light. As the Tories brandished their
swords for the rush, Tom heard a slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
sound behind him; turning his head a little
he saw Lucy Foster, pale faced and with
clasped hands, standing upon the landing
near the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come any farther, if you value your
safety and mine, also,&#8221; he had just time to
call to her, and then the Tories were upon
him. Clarage was first; he delivered a
mighty cut at Tom&#8217;s head, but it was put
aside and the young swamp-rider&#8217;s blade bit
deeply into his right shoulder. Clarage
uttered a roar of rage; his right arm was
helpless, but he transferred his sword to his
left and came on again. At each side of
Clarage and over his shoulder the other
Tories were cutting and thrusting desperately
at Tom. The blows came swiftly and frequently;
but his blade met them all, darting
here and there like a streak of light and
seeming at times to twine about their own
like the coils of a metallic snake.</p>

<p>Desperately the battle waged on their part
and gallantly upon his; the girl behind him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
upon the landing, more than once cried out
in fear as she saw almost certain death threatening
the youth from the Tories&#8217; sword points;
but each time he redoubled his exertions and
swept the staircase clear of his foes.</p>

<p>However, this could not last; he was but
human, and his strength at last began to fail;
two of his assailants were lying, disabled, at
the foot of the stairs, and the others, to a
man, bore testimony to his prowess. But,
when they saw his strength waning, under
the urging of Mark Harwood they pressed
upon him, dealing showers of blows with
their heavy sabres.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surrender,&#8221; cried Mark Harwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take me, if you get me at all,&#8221;
panted Tom, dealing an ugly cut at the
nearest Tory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take you we will,&#8221; shouted the bull
voice of Clarage. &#8220;Press on, men; he cannot
strike so swiftly now. Press on and we
have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crowded upon him with loud shouts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and whirling swords. Step by step he was
beaten back, breathless, exhausted, but fighting
on. And when the moment came when
he must be taken or cut down, there was a
sudden crashing sound from behind him; the
glass of the window at the landing was splintered
and the frame was dashed in upon the
floor. The lad&#8217;s heart sank, for he fancied it
must be some of the enemy come to take him
in the rear. He dared not turn his head to
see, for the blows were showering about him;
but, then, his heart gave a great bound of joy
as a strange, weird cry sounded in his ears
and the giant form of Cole sprang through
the shattered window and stood towering and
glaring beside him.</p>

<p>But, as it chanced, the colossal slave was
weaponless. Mighty as was his strength he
could not pit his naked hands against the
Tories&#8217; swords. At the turn of the staircase,
on the landing, a thick oaken post, carved
and about the height of a fair-sized man
stood, supporting the stair-rail.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_194.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">
<i>STEP BY STEP HE WAS<br />
BEATEN BACK</i></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>With a bound he had reached it; with a
mighty wrench he tore it from its place; and,
waving this massive weapon as lightly as a
child would a sword of lath, he flung himself
into the fight.</p>

<p>Tom was about striking his last weak blow,
as the Tories saw clearly. But before the
terrific onslaught of the giant they recoiled,
amazed; the huge club wheeled about his
head once, twice, thrice and they were swept,
howling, to the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brave Cole!&#8221; Tom gasped the words as
he sank back upon the stairs, exhausted.
&#8220;Strike hard; it&#8217;s our lives or theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that time one of the party discovered
Mr. Foster&#8217;s arms chest; the Tories threw
themselves upon it with shouts of delight and
in another moment a blazing volley swept
up the staircase, the bullets singing spitefully
past Cole&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back,&#8221; cried Tom. &#8220;Back, Cole.&#8221;</p>

<p>They bounded round the turn in the stairs,
Tom bearing the frightened girl with him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Another volley crashed into the wall, behind
where they had just stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will be upon us in a moment,&#8221; said
Tom, his face pale, but his eyes burning with
a resolute light. &#8220;Miss Lucy, leave us; we
cannot hope to hold them back, now; you
will be in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tories were reloading in the hall;
Clarage was roaring in furious delight and
stamping about like an enraged lion. Cole
was rapidly telling Tom all about what had
been done at the barn, his fingers flying like
mad.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are ours now,&#8221; stormed Clarage, in
loud triumph. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make them beg; the
rebels, the dogs&mdash;we&#8217;ll show them what king&#8217;s
men can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s high time you were doing it.&#8221; Tom
bent over the broken rail at the place from
where Cole had torn his mighty club. &#8220;It
seems to me, the loyal subjects of the king
have performed rather badly to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll do better from now on,&#8221; laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
Clarage, who had in the height of their triumph
actually begun to grow good-humored.
&#8220;Are you ready, gentlemen?&#8221; to the
others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; came a chorus.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of all, Tom Deering
stepped boldly forward into plain view; he
was without weapons, and Clarage, with a roar
of laughter, at once jumped to the conclusion
that he meant to surrender.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has weakened,&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;The
rebel has weakened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot him down,&#8221; cried Mark Harwood,
from well in the rear. &#8220;No quarter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom held up his hand, quietly; he showed
not the slightest trace of fear, for the things
that Cole had made him understand had
filled him with confidence. The Tories
below gazed up at him in astonishment.
Tom spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;I charge all men within hearing of my
voice to lay down their arms, in peace. You
are enemies to your neighbors and to Carolina,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
and in the name of the Continental
Congress, I call upon you to surrender.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mad!&#8221; burst out Clarage, &#8220;as mad
as a March hare!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with him,&#8221; shrilled the voice of
Mark Harwood. &#8220;No quarter to the rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The muskets were about to be raised to
their owners&#8217; shoulders; Tom&#8217;s voice rang
out warningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On your lives, lay down your arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shout of derision greeted the words;
then the young swamp-rider&#8217;s fingers went to
his lips and a sharp, shrill whistle split the
air. It was the signal that Cole had arranged
with the released prisoners; and like magic
it was answered. Through every door and
window, it seemed, sprang a resolute man;
before the Tories could raise a hand a shattering
volley was poured into them. A cloud
of smoke, cries and the sound of heavy blows
were swept up the staircase; Lucy, her hand
pressed to her wildly-beating heart, made as
though to look over the rail at the awful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
scene below. But Tom put her aside, almost
roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There is nothing
there for you to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth
when the door below opened with a crash;
shouts and cries were heard upon the veranda
and lawn. Tom rushed to a window and
looked out. He was just in time to see Mark
Harwood, Clarage and the other surviving
Tories rush toward the barn, spring upon the
backs of the horses which the liberated prisoners
had brought out for their own use, and
gallop swiftly away.</p>

<small>HOW MARION&#8217;S MEN LAY IN AMBUSH, AND
WHAT CAME OF IT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> encounter of Tom Deering with the
loyalists at the Foster mansion made a great
stir. Mr. Foster, of course, could no longer
remain at his home, where the British were
likely to close in upon him at any time; so
he and Lucy, taking their most valuable possessions,
made their way northward toward
Virginia. From this time on, also, the British
commander, Cornwallis, displayed a greater
solicitude than ever in the attempts to capture
Marion and disperse his band of horsemen.</p>

<p>The legion of Tarleton and a strong force
under Major Wemyss were set in motion to
beat him out of his retreats in the cane-brakes
and swamps. It was Cornwallis&#8217; intention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
have these forces cooperate, but Tarleton was
delayed and Wemyss would not wait for him.</p>

<p>Through his young scout Marion was kept
posted as to the movements of the advancing
enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Wemyss is in command of the
Sixty-third Regiment,&#8221; reported Tom, &#8220;and
he has with him, also, a large party of Tories,
under Clarage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Colonel Marion, briefly.
&#8220;We must prepare to give them the reception
that is due them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major James, a gallant and skilful officer,
was summoned and despatched with a select
body of volunteers to reconnoitre. All the
outposts were called in and, thus united,
Marion followed swiftly upon the footsteps of
James.</p>

<p>Accompanying the latter was Tom, Cole,
and Nat and David Collins. They pushed
quickly forward among the morasses and
sunk-land, under the great trees hanging
with moss and a rank growth of creepers; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
at last Major James gave the word to
halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deering,&#8221; said he to Tom, &#8220;ride carefully
forward. I fancy we are about to come in
touch with the enemy. Take a few of the
men with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom selected Cole, of course, and the two
Collinses. They rode slowly forward, in
Indian file, along a narrow road between two
impassable morasses, alert and cautious, never
for a moment forgetting that they were in
the neighborhood of the British.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear,&#8221; said Nat Collins, who rode at
Tom&#8217;s side, &#8220;that Clarage took some prisoners
north of this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners!&#8221; the word always had a peculiar
interest for Tom; it set him thinking of
his father, so long in the hands of the British&mdash;made
him long for a sight of him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rich booty came with these prisoners,
too, so the report goes,&#8221; continued Nat. &#8220;A
booty that King George&#8217;s treasury will never
see, I suppose.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>&#8220;The Tories make this war an excuse for
plunder,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;A great many of
them are more actuated by a desire to seize
upon their neighbors&#8217; goods, than by longing
to serve King George.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole, who rode in front, at this point drew
rein upon Dando, and held up his hand. All
halted immediately. From far off in the
swamp came a low, steady sound, a rising
and falling that seemed to draw nearer with
each passing moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked David Collins, in a
hushed voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the sound of hoofs,&#8221; answered
Tom. &#8220;Hoof-beats in a swamp, I&#8217;ve noticed,
have a strangeness about them that seems
uncanny. The ground is so soft, and the
thick growth muffles the sound so. I&#8217;ve lain
and listened to them many times in the night;
they sound all the more strange coming
through the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was not sure that this was the same
sound; and they became silent once more and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
listened attentively. Suddenly a night bird
began to wheel in short circles above the tree-top,
and its rasping cries broke the stillness
abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll not be able to make sure while that
fellow is about,&#8221; laughed Tom. &#8220;He seems
to object to our presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dismounted and gave Sultan&#8217;s rein to
Cole. Kneeling in the narrow road he
pressed his ear to the ground, and kept it
there for a long time. At length he arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, horses,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and quite a lot of
them. They seem to be coming along the
main road, west of here.&#8221; He remounted
Sultan and sat silently for a moment. Then
he continued, &#8220;They are going in the direction
of the ford that crosses the Congaree near
Fort Mott. There is only one reason why a
party of the enemy should be heading for
Fort Mott at this time, when they have only
started out to seek us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; broke in Nat Collins, &#8220;I know
what you are thinking. It&#8217;s the Tories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
under Clarage, and they are taking the
prisoners, which I spoke of, to the fort for
safe keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Tom, his eyes snapping;
&#8220;that is exactly what occurred to me. And,
look here, what a pity it is that Major James
is not here, and the rest of his men. The
Tories will be forced to pass the ruined mill
that stands back from the west road, a short
distance from here. We could reach that
point long before them, judging from the
sound of their horses&#8217; feet, and we could give
them a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence; then Nat
and David broke forth, at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us try it&mdash;alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom laughed in sheer glee, and cried excitedly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; in a breath.</p>

<p>Tom turned to Cole. The great negro
grinned; anything that his young master
thought of doing was always of great interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
to Cole, because, as a rule, what his young
master thought it worth while to do usually
contained some spice of excitement. Tom
knew what the slave&#8217;s grin expressed as well
as though it had been in words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;We&#8217;re all agreed;
and we&#8217;ll try it alone. It can do no harm,
even if we fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wheeling their horses they spurred back
along the road by which they had come,
until they struck a narrow path branching
toward the west. Galloping through such a
swamp as that and along such a narrow,
crooked track, in the darkness, was a most
dangerous proceeding; but they were all
young and danger, to their ardent spirits,
meant but little.</p>

<p>The old mill of which Tom had spoken lay
upon the west road&mdash;that is the road leading
to the Congaree;&mdash;it was deserted and had
fallen into ruins years before. It was seldom
that any one troubled it with his presence;
so it was an ideal spot for a surprise or ambuscade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
A sharp gallop of, perhaps, a quarter
of an hour brought our four adventurers to
the old mill. The moon was shining brightly;
but the overhanging trees that surrounded
the ruin threw it into a deep shadow. A
dense thicket stretched along the roadside
well in this shadow, and it was behind this
that our friends ensconced themselves, after
first securing their horses among the trees.</p>

<p>The hoof-beats of the party advancing along
the western road now sounded distinctly in
their ears. There was little wind, but it was
blowing in their direction, and it carried the
ringing strokes toward them when the approaching
riders came upon a stony part of
the road; but, as a rule, the sound was thick,
dull and heavy, for the ground was soggy, for
the most part, and low.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look well to your primings,&#8221; spoke Tom,
as they crouched behind the thicket. &#8220;And
keep your pistols at hand, for we will need a
second volley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the riders; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
rumble of wheels could, also, now be distinguished;
and soon in the moonlit road
they saw about a dozen horsemen, some riding
ahead and some alongside a small train of
four wagons.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an escort with Clarage&#8217;s prisoners,
sure enough,&#8221; Nat Collins breathed into Tom
Deering&#8217;s ear. &#8220;See, they have all the
plunder in the wagons, just as they took it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wagons rumbled along slowly, drawn
by plodding old plough-horses; the steeds of
the escort champed at their bits and pranced
impatiently at the slowness of the pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready,&#8221; ordered Tom, in a low, sharp
whisper. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cavalcade was almost abreast of them
when one of the escort called out, apparently
addressing some one in one of the wagons.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you thought you would run off up to
Virginia, did you, Master Foster, and give us
the slip! Well, it&#8217;s a rare good thing that
I fell in with you, or who knows but you
might have fallen in with some dishonest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
rogues upon the way who might have robbed
you of the valuables contained in your
wagons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Clarage, himself,&#8221; said Tom, startled.
&#8220;And his prisoners are Mr. Foster and his
daughter Lucy.&#8221; He paused a moment, then
leveled his piece over the top of the thicket,
his companions doing likewise. &#8220;Fire,&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>The four leveled rifles were discharged at
once; two men fell from their saddles into
the road; another, desperately wounded, clung
to his horse&#8217;s neck as it raced madly away
along the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your ground,&#8221; roared Clarage, his
bull-like voice plainly to be heard above all
the confusion. His men had drawn together
in a group, their horses pawing and fighting
for their heads against the tautly-drawn
bridles.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pistols,&#8221; whispered Tom. &#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The long-barreled pistols, of which each of
the swamp-riders carried two, exploded in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
turn; a man and several horses went down;
then the second pistol came into play for a
third volley with deadly results. By this
time Clarage and his followers, or what were
left of them, were struck by a panic; the
three volleys of shots from the thicket made
it seem as though the ambushment was composed
of a great number of men; so, when
the four leaped in a body into the road, their
swords flashing, and Tom turned and called,
as though cheering on still more, &#8220;Come on,
lads; down with the Tories,&#8221; the escort could
not be restrained, but gave rein to their steeds
and fled down the road toward the Congaree
with the raging Clarage thundering at their
heels at every bound.</p>

<p>At their flight Tom placed his foot on the
hub of a wheel and sprang into the leading
wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;Mr. Foster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mars Tom,&#8221; cried Dogberry, who had
been driving the wagon, but who at the first
shot had dived under the seat. &#8220;It&#8217;s Mars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Tom, Missy Lucy. We&#8217;s safe again. Ha, ha,
ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment Lucy Foster and her father
were thanking them for this timely service.
Both were pale and worn-looking, especially
Mr. Foster, who had been greatly disturbed at
the attack of the swamp-riders.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were on our way north,&#8221; explained
Mr. Foster, &#8220;and were approaching Fishdam
Ferry when we were pounced upon by this
man Clarage and his ruffians. All that I
have been able to save is contained in these
wagons; that and our lives, also, would have
been lost had you not appeared just as you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, when will it all end,&#8221; cried poor
Lucy, wringing her hands. &#8220;It is dreadful;
I shall never forget the scenes I have witnessed
in the past few weeks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fear,&#8221; soothed Tom. &#8220;Marion will
lend you an escort and see your father safe on
your journey. Meanwhile we had better be
on our way back. Major James will be awaiting
us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Upon their return to the spot where they
had left their party they found that Major
James, upon his own account, had also surprised
a party of the enemy and routed them
without loss of a man. So, with Mr. Foster&#8217;s
wagons rolling along in the midst of them
they made their way toward the point where
they were to meet Marion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>HOW TOM MET WITH A BLINDFOLD ADVENTURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the fall Marion defeated a large body of
the enemy at the Black Wingo. News had
filtered its way into Carolina that General
Greene had succeeded Gates and was advancing
with fresh recruits and the remnant of
the fugitives who survived the fatal battle of
Camden. Marion was most anxious to show
Greene and his Continentals that there was a
spirit in the state, so he became more than
usually active.</p>

<p>He recruited his force at Williamsburg and
was marching to attack Colonel Harrison, who
was in force upon Lynch&#8217;s Creek; but his
progress in this direction was suddenly arrested
one afternoon when Tom and Cole
dashed back from a scout and informed him
that there was a large gathering of Tories in
and about Salem and the fork of the Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
River. Colonel Tynes, who commanded this
force, had brought with him large supplies of
the materials of war and comfort-things in
which Marion&#8217;s riders stood very much in
need. Tom drew pictures of new English
muskets, broadswords, bayonets, pistols, saddles
and bridles, powder and ball, and large
stores of hard money which Tynes had also
brought to tempt new levies.</p>

<p>His men wanted so much for all these
things that Marion could not resist the boy&#8217;s
eloquence. Harrison, for the time, was forgotten;
and the half-naked brigade was
headed for Tarcote, in the forks of the Black
River. Crossing the lower ford of the northern
branch of the river, at Nelson&#8217;s plantation,
Marion came upon the camp of Tynes at
midnight. A hurried survey revealed the
fact that the Tories had made no preparation
to ward off an attack. Most of them were
asleep; but many were grouped about the
camp-fires.</p>

<p>Hastily collecting his men, Marion struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
like lightning. The surprise was complete;
the panic universal. Marion lost not a single
man, and gained a great store of clothing,
arms and ammunition, as Tom had predicted
he would.</p>

<p>One after another these victories came;
they were small in themselves but they gave
the patriots courage; they revived spirits that
had drooped since the taking of Charleston
and the burnings and hangings by Tarleton
and his fierce dragoons. As the leaves yellowed
and fell, and long before the Christmas
season set in, the cause of liberty once more
grew bright in Carolina.</p>

<p>Cornwallis was quick to feel this; his
parties were continually under arms; his
columns were ever scouring the country for
the elusive but dangerous foe. But Marion
had taught his countrymen how to fight their
powerful enemy; surprise, ambuscades, night
marches, rapid retreats&mdash;that was the story of
his work, and it brought the British, as far as
results were concerned, almost to a standstill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>On December 30, 1780, Cornwallis, from
his camp at Winnsborough, wrote to Sir
Henry Clinton at New York:</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Marion has so wrought upon the
minds of the people ... that there is
scarcely an inhabitant between the Santee and
Peedee that is not in arms against us. Some
parties have even crossed the Santee and carried
terror to the gates of Charleston.&#8221;</p>

<p>The daring expedition of which the British
general wrote was led by Tom Deering. For
a long time he had been brooding upon the
words of Mark Harwood spoken that day at
the Foster mansion. Laura was to be forced
by Jarvis Harwood to marry Lieutenant
Cheyne at Christmas. This, together with
his inability to do anything for his imprisoned
father weighed heavily upon him; he
could not sleep at night, and during the day
his helplessness to carry relief to those he
cared most for in the world preyed constantly
upon him, allowing him no rest. Oh, if he
could only strike a blow for them; if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
could only liberate his father from the hulks
in Charleston harbor&mdash;for he felt almost sure,
by this, that it was there he would find him&mdash;and
save Laura from Jasper Harwood, he
would be happy and content.</p>

<p>He sat one night upon a cottonwood stump
at the camp-fire brooding over these things,
with Cole stretched full length beside him,
when Marion, who was going the rounds of
the camp, stopped to look at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something,&#8221; said the commander,
seating himself beside him on the stump,
&#8220;that has been upon your mind for some
weeks past. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not often that Colonel Marion invited
a confidence; he was as kind and gentle
a man as could be, but, as a rule, he treated
his men not too familiarly. So, his question
proved his interest to Tom at once.</p>

<p>The lad told him of Laura, and of what
was to happen at Christmas. Marion listened
and his dark, deep-set eyes kindled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The villains,&#8221; said he, warmly. &#8220;They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
would make this poor girl the wife of a man
whom she does not care for, in order to create
an influence that will enable them to possess
themselves of your father&#8217;s property.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, then turned suddenly
upon his young scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had not the cares and responsibilities
of this command resting upon me,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I would ask nothing better than to
beard them under their own guns and take
this poor child from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I could only make the attempt!&#8221;
cried Tom. &#8220;I could learn something of my
father, too, perhaps. If I only had the force,
I would dare it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would any of your friends in the
brigade volunteer for the adventure, do you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A score of them!&#8221; exclaimed the
youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my permission to take them
out on the enterprise,&#8221; said Marion, kindly.
&#8220;It will not only be doing the young lady a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
service if you succeed, but will demonstrate
to the enemy that we can penetrate even into
his most powerful towns.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last Tom had the chance he had so often
prayed for. Overjoyed, he went to work
next day sounding his most intimate friends
in the brigade; he went to the younger men
from choice, for it was to these that the boldness
of the proposed attempt would appeal.
Without the slightest difficulty he secured
the eager consent of the required number;
and all day they prepared for the expedition
by polishing and cleaning rifles and pistols
and looking to the edges of sabres. At dusk,
well-mounted and armed, and with high,
hopeful hearts they set forth. The brigade
waved their caps and gave them three silent
cheers, for Marion had forbidden noise in the
camp.</p>

<p>The camp of Marion at this period was in
the midst of a dense cane-brake in the district
between Fort Watson and Georgetown; he
had not as yet settled into his famous base at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Snow&#8217;s Island, and was conducting his operations
from many different points.</p>

<p>The party under Tom Deering forded the
Santee in safety, and by hard riding and no
mishaps made Monks Corner, on the west
bank of the Cooper River, by daybreak the
next day. Of course they did not enter the
town, but remained some distance outside,
encamped upon a small creek. At nightfall
they resumed their journey; now and then
they met a rider or a carriage in the road;
but they were too far into the enemy&#8217;s country
for any one to suspect them of being anything
else than king&#8217;s men, so boldly and confidently
did they push forward.</p>

<p>The coming of day found them in the
suburbs of Charleston; the houses began to
appear more frequently along the road, and
when the sun at last showed itself in the
east they were trotting along a wide road
toward a small inn which stood, together with
a stable and some other outbuildings, just a
trifle to one side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;This is Natchez&#8217;s place,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;we
stop here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Natchez, it was thought, was an Indian of
at least quarter blood; he had kept the inn by
the roadside for many years, and was a queer,
silent sort of an old man and an unquestioned
though secret friend of the patriot cause.
Marion had, at times, occasion to send a spy
into Charleston; and it was always at the
Indian&#8217;s Head&mdash;for so the inn was called&mdash;that
the venturesome one found shelter.</p>

<p>When our friends drew rein before the inn
door, Natchez, who seemed always to be stirring,
came out. Tom gave him a quick signal
and the old man peered up at him from
under his bushy eyebrows, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;So many of you!&#8221; he exclaimed, holding
up his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must remain here until dark,&#8221; said
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not an attack upon the city?&#8221;
asked the old man, eagerly. &#8220;Where is
Marion?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;Back in the swamps, across the Santee.
We are upon a secret errand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is dangerous to hide so many,&#8221; said
Natchez, complainingly. &#8220;You will have to
be satisfied with the barn; I cannot have you
in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The barn will answer very well,&#8221; agreed
Tom. &#8220;But open the doors and let us put
up our horses; we have had a hard ride,
Natchez; man and beast, both, are hungry
and tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>The barn was a good-sized one and very
well able to accommodate their mounts.
They climbed into the loft, themselves; there
were great piles of sweet-smelling hay there,
and after Natchez and an old negro slave had
served them with a plentiful breakfast, they
curled up and slept soundly through the long
day.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Tom awoke; the
others were still sleeping; so he climbed
down the ladder, and after giving a careful
look at the horses to see that they had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
well provided for, he made his way to the
inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Natchez,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Any news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; grunted the old man. He was
sitting upon a wooden bench that ran along
in front of the inn, his legs crossed and his
hands clasped around his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something?&#8221; Tom looked at
him, questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man was here,&#8221; said Natchez. &#8220;I
think he look for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man, looking for me!&#8221; Tom was
startled, and darted a quick look all about.
&#8220;You must be mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Natchez shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he positively; &#8220;he look for
you. He come here once, twice, three times.
And every time he look for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom sat down upon the bench and looked
at the old man. There was no one, save his
own party, who knew that he was at the Indian&#8217;s
Head&mdash;but, stay; perhaps Marion desired
to convey some word to him, and suspecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
that he would halt at the inn, had
sent a rider after him. However, this could
soon be ascertained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the man have the signal?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Natchez, &#8220;no signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>That put the question at rest; the man was
not from Marion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a man was he?&#8221; asked he,
at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man&mdash;gray hair&mdash;one eye&mdash;wooden
leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this catalogue of infirmities Tom burst
into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he must be a peculiar looking person,
to be sure,&#8221; remarked he. &#8220;What did
he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Him have paper,&#8221; said Natchez. &#8220;Him
read it. The paper have you on, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was puzzled; the whole affair seemed
very queer; perhaps the British had learned&mdash;but
no; if they knew of his and his companions&#8217;
presence at the Indian&#8217;s Head, they
would have made the fact known by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
of a company of dragoons, and not in this
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was here three times, you say,&#8221; he
said to Natchez.</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he say he come once more,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Tom looked surprised. &#8220;Well,
in that case I can find out just who and what
he is and what he wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a time Natchez went into the inn to
attend to some duties; Tom remained upon
the bench, playing with a lively pointer pup,
which had approached him in a friendly manner.
His companions showed no signs of
having awakened; the sun was going down
behind a wooded rise in the ground and the
long, wide road stretched away toward the
city dusty and deserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my peculiar looking friend wants me
he had better hurry,&#8221; muttered Tom. &#8220;It&#8217;s
almost time for us to take the road once
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had barely ceased speaking when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
noticed, far down the road, where all had
been deserted a few moments before, the figure
of a man slowly approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can this be he?&#8221; Tom pushed the frolicking
puppy from him, and looked long and
earnestly toward the figure. The man came
nearer and nearer; his pace was very slow
and he walked with the assistance of a cane.
&#8220;Yes!&#8221; suddenly, &#8220;it is he. There is his
wooden leg&mdash;and his hair is gray&mdash;and he
has but one eye!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man continued to slowly advance;
when he reached a point in the road directly
in front of the inn, he paused. His remaining
eye seemed very dim of sight, for at first
he did not seem to see Tom. But when, at
last, he did make him out, he came nearer
and peered at him with great anxiety. He
was a stout man with a fat, flabby, white
face; his single eye squinted through a steel-rimmed
glass; his breath was being drawn
fast and with some difficulty, for his walk
seemed to have exhausted him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>He was forced, in order to see Tom plainly,
to come very close; he said nothing, but only
looked. Tom sat, silently awaiting the outcome
of the inspection. At length a look of
satisfaction spread over the man&#8217;s face; he
grinned with delight, and a chuckling seemed
to shake him all over.</p>

<p>He put his hand into his breast pocket and
took out a folded paper; unfolding it with
great care, he adjusted his glass and proceeded
to read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man&mdash;tall&mdash;brown hair&mdash;gray eyes&mdash;not
very well dressed,&#8221; he lowered the
paper and fastened the youth on the bench
with his single eye. &#8220;That&#8217;s you, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It describes me pretty well,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;It describes you exactly,&#8221; said the one-eyed
man with the wooden leg. Then he
turned his attention to the paper once more.
&#8220;Will be at the Indian&#8217;s Head just outside
the city, on the evening of December 23d.&#8221;
He looked up at Tom, once more. &#8220;This is
the Indian&#8217;s Head, is it not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is the evening of December
23d?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom laughed; and the one-eyed man
looked hurriedly at the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not say anything about your
laughing,&#8221; he informed Tom, at last, &#8220;but I
suppose it&#8217;s all right. But, let us get down
to business. Here are,&#8221; and he drew out a
bulky packet, &#8220;your instructions.&#8221; He
handed the packet to Tom without more ado,
and drew out another paper; this one had an
official look and bore a large seal. &#8220;And
here,&#8221; went on the man, &#8220;is your permit to
enter the city and leave it as you will, without
fear and without question, and to have
what helpers you require bear you company.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the permit to Tom; then he
turned and began stumping away on his
wooden leg and cane, without another word.
Tom arose hastily; the papers were not for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
him, he was confident of that. He was about
to call to the man to return; but the permit&mdash;the
free and unquestioned entry into Charleston&mdash;was
too much; he sank back into his
seat and watched and watched the wooden-legged
man until he disappeared down the
long, dusty road.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the passport carefully.
It bore the signature and seal of Cornwallis
and, as the man had said, permitted the
bearer to pass in and out of the city at all
hours and with whatever company rode with
him. It bore no name other than that of the
signature, and Tom grew puzzled and disturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; muttered he, &#8220;it is for me,
after all. Some one in the city might have
known of my desire to save Laura, and my
father and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the thing was too improbable. It was,
indeed, impossible. The packet which the
man had said held instructions lay upon his
knee; it was not sealed, the several documents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
which it contained were merely laid
loosely together. Tom thought for some time
over the right and wrong of looking into this
packet; it could not have been meant for
him; therefore would it be right to examine
it?</p>

<p>It took but a few moments, however, for
him to decide; it was perfectly right to gain
information from the enemy by intercepting
his despatches; and these papers might be
something of that nature. His mind once
made up he was soon acquainted with the
secrets that the papers held. They were
written in a large, flowing hand; but, just
like the passport, none of them contained the
name of the person for whom they were intended.
And, in this case, the name of the
writer was lacking, also! Opening the first
Tom read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your venture has become known to us in
a rather strange way. It is dangerous, but
may do great good. In any case, you may
depend upon us to do all that we can for you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
The passport which I send you will admit
you into the city. Come to-night, and alone;
as the clock strikes ten stand in front of the
king&#8217;s statue near Lord Rawdon&#8217;s headquarters.
I will have a person there to conduct
you to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other papers contained names of persons
and references to things that Tom did
not understand; but a footnote upon one of
them read:</p>

<p>&#8220;These may not seem very clear to you, but
all will be explained later.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time Tom pondered over all
this. Was it possible, after all, that some one
had learned of his enterprise and was about to
help him in the accomplishment of it? The
person, whoever it was, must be high in the
favor of the British; for such a passport as
that which he held was not an easy thing to
secure.</p>

<p>And then, again, it might be all a ruse; it
might be a trap&mdash;a snare, set to catch him
and those who rode with him. In a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
time the others were awake and he placed the
matter before them. To say that they were
astonished would be putting it mildly. But,
to a man, they thought it all right. Because,
they argued, and Tom thought with reason,
if it were the enemy who sent the papers,
why did they trouble to do it? A squadron,
surrounding the barn as they slept, would
have been a safer and much more simple way
of capturing them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were you I&#8217;d see it out,&#8221; said Nat
Collins, decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I! and I!&#8221; cried the others.</p>

<p>Cole was the only one who seemed at all
dubious; but as the white youths seemed to
be so firm in their belief that everything was
right, he said nothing; and when Tom told
him to saddle Sultan he did so without a
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll return some time to-morrow,&#8221; said the
young scout as he settled himself in the saddle.
&#8220;Natchez will take care of you all.
Don&#8217;t expose yourselves to the view of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
one coming along the road; but lay low.
And now I&#8217;m away!&#8221; He shook the rein.
&#8220;Good-bye, boys; good-bye, Cole.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this he set off at a sharp gallop toward
the city. Darkness had come on some
time before, but the road was excellent and
he had no fear of accidents. As he drew
close to the town a sentry halted him. But
the passport of the Earl of Cornwallis met
with an instant salute and he was allowed to
proceed. This occurred several times; but
always with the same result. And, at last,
he rode into the city&#8217;s streets at about the
hour of nine. It had been many long
months since he had last been in Charleston;
everything remained the same, however, except
for the flaunting of the British flag which
hung from every flagstaff, and the many redcoats
to be seen on the streets, swaggering
dragoons and stalwart grenadiers, who seemed
to look with contempt upon the townsfolk,
loyalist and patriot alike.</p>

<p>Tom put Sultan up at a neighboring hostelry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and then wandered about the city to
pass the time between that and the hour at
which he was to meet the guide who was to
lead him to the person who had sent the
papers. He had his sabre strapped to his side
and carried a heavy pistol in his breast; people
would frequently stop and look after him
as he passed, his hunting-shirt, worn leather
leggings and the rest of his attire attracting
their attention. Quite often a dragoon, or
foot soldier would pause and stare into his
face rudely as though they had seen his like
before and had their suspicions of him; but
his steady eyes and confident bearing drove
from their minds any intention they may
have had of stopping him.</p>

<p>As ten o&#8217;clock struck in the tower of a
near-by church, he stopped before the statue
of King George, near the governor&#8217;s headquarters.
At the same instant a man came
out of a shadow immediately across the way
and approached him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;Are you awaiting any one?&#8221; asked the
newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What word do you bring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bring no word.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked at him for a moment,
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very strange,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Tom drew out the message making the
queer appointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will this do?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The man gave it a quick glance and looked
relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, &#8220;why did you not show it
at first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked for a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, I did. But it is all right. Are
you,&#8221; looking at the lad suddenly, &#8220;prepared
to follow me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Where is your horse?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>Tom informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;As it happens,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;my mount
is at the same place.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they bent their steps toward the inn
where Sultan had been put up, Tom looked
at his companion carefully. He was a very
tall and very spare man, but his shoulders
were wide and his chest deep. He was attired
in sober black; his hair was dark, his
complexion swarthy, and an angry looking
scar crossed his right cheek. Thinking it as
well to secure what information he could
from the guide Tom asked,</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you about to take me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; answered the man, &#8220;permitted
to give information of any kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested the youth, &#8220;the person
who wrote this paper must at least&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not speak of any person or persons,
if you please,&#8221; put in the man, curtly.
&#8220;My instructions were to conduct you to a
certain spot. What else is going forward is
not my affair; I can say nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Surprised at this, and rather startled at the
increased mystery, Tom stepped along at the
man&#8217;s side in silence, until they reached the
hostelry where the horses were. A groom
saddled them quickly and brought them out;
the man who was to act as guide for Tom at
once sprang upon the fine gray horse which
was led up to the block. Tom mounted Sultan
slowly; the groom seemed to know the dark
man with the scar; this interested our young
swamp-rider, and he would have given a good
deal for a quiet word before they rode away.</p>

<p>But this was impossible; the guide never
took his sharp eyes from the youth; he
seemed to be expecting some such attempt;
and of course while he watched, Tom could
not make it. They set off through the city
by much the same route as Tom had entered
it. When they reached a quiet spot the man
with the scar pulled up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young, sir,&#8221; said he gravely; &#8220;if I am
not mistaken this errand means much to you
and&mdash;and&mdash;well, others.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;It does,&#8221; answered Tom, his mind reverting
to Laura.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would risk much to carry it through,
would you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am risking much as it is,&#8221; answered
Tom, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;True; so you are. But there is one thing
of which I wish to inform you before we
proceed further. He who follows me to-night,
must follow blindfolded!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom flashed him a quick look; for a moment
the proposition staggered him. Had
he come too far? was he about to enter a
snare, or could it be that he was already in
one! The dark man noticed his hesitation
and a smile glimmered across his hawk-like
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not afraid?&#8221; asked he; and
there was something like a sneer lurking in
his even tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; said Tom, proudly. &#8220;I am here
for a purpose; if it is necessary for me to be
blindfolded to carry it through, then blindfolded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
I will be. I have faced sterner things
than darkness and a single man, sir, many
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scarred-faced man laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me that you were not lacking
in courage,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and I find that they
were right. But come,&#8221; he took a large black
kerchief from his pocket, &#8220;we have no time
to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>He urged his big gray horse alongside
Sultan; in a moment the black kerchief was
tightly tied about Tom&#8217;s eyes; the lad could
not see anything&mdash;all was dark&mdash;black&mdash;unknown!</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ride slightly ahead,&#8221; said the man
quietly when his task was done. &#8220;Give your
horse a free rein; he will follow mine, and
in that way you need have no fear of his
carrying you into danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom said nothing in reply; he was not
quite as sure of this as the guide seemed to
think he should be. It was a strange experience
to be riding through the enemy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
country, under the guidance of a stranger
and upon an errand whose every element
breathed mystery; he did not know at what
moment a quick, deadly blow might fall upon
him; his hand rested upon the butt of his
pistol, ready to draw it forth at a moment&#8217;s
notice; his ears were constantly strained to
catch the slightest sound that might portend
danger.</p>

<p>They rode for a long time, then suddenly
turned off the road, and headed across a plantation
which lay to the left. They continued
across this for some time, then turned off another
road, and this time to the right. Within
the next half hour they turned and twisted
in many directions; Tom realized that the
purpose was to confuse him; the place where
he was to meet the writer of the strange message
was to remain a mystery, it was considered
necessary to prevent his knowing the
way there did he ever desire to repeat the
visit.</p>

<p>At last the hoofs began to ring upon harder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
ground; the guide drew up, and from the
creaking sound, Tom knew that he was opening
a gate. He was cool and collected, but he
could not help his breath coming a little
quicker; he was almost at the end of the
adventure; in a few moments he would know
all. They rode inside and the gate closed
behind them. Tom heard some low, guarded
words addressed to his companion, but could
not catch their meaning. Then came the
quick command:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dismount!&#8221;</p>

<p>He slid to the ground and stood leaning
against Sultan&#8217;s shoulder, unable to take a
step in safety because of the blinding kerchief.
A hand was placed upon his shoulder,
and a new voice, rather less brusque than that
of the man with the scar on his face, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my friend, I am going to lead you
to the person you desire to see. Under no
circumstances attempt to remove the bandage
from your eyes until told; this affair is a
most dangerous one, and the utmost secrecy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
must be maintained. You understand that,
of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom. Of course, he thought,
it would not do for the writer of the message
to be suspected of having assisted him, a
member of Marion&#8217;s Brigade, into the city.
That was, then, the reason for all this secrecy.</p>

<p>He was led quickly up a flight of stone
steps; a heavy door opened and closed behind
him. They then passed down a long corridor,
and entered a room where, as Tom could
perceive even through the thick bandage,
there were a great many brilliant lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the person who had conducted
him, &#8220;I am going to leave you here. Wait
the space of a full minute; then you may remove
the bandage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom heard his footstep cross the floor and
the door softly close behind him. All was
then silent; his ears were straining to catch
any sound that would indicate the presence
of any one else in the apartment; he longed
to tear the blinding kerchief from his eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
He could hear a great, solemn clock in the
room slowly ticking off the seconds, each of
which seemed an age; but, at last, unable any
longer to bear the suspense, he pulled the
bandage away with a sudden jerk, and glared
about him.</p>

<p>Many candles were burning upon tables,
stands and in brackets on the wall. As he
gazed at his surroundings a strange sense of
familiarity came to him; the furnishings, the
shape of the room, the position of the windows
and doors, the pictures upon the walls.</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no mistake,&#8221; he whispered to
himself, a strange chill creeping over him.
&#8220;I am standing in my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wonder possessed him; the thing was
strange beyond his dreams of strangeness;
he could, try as he would, make nothing of
it. Then footsteps sounded&mdash;heavy, commanding
footsteps that approached the door
leading into the room from the main hall.
Tom stood in the middle of the apartment
bathed in the full glare of the lighted candles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
waiting; the door opened and two British
officers entered, each big, red-faced and imperious-looking,
and each bearing upon the
breast of his scarlet coat many glittering
orders and decorations.</p>

<p>They were Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton and
the Earl of Cornwallis!</p>

<small>HOW TOM TOOK PART IN A MYSTERIOUS
CONSULTATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Tom Deering was rendered
powerless by the sudden shock of the surprise;
he stood staring at the two British
officers with wide-open eyes. Then a feeling
of helplessness swept over him&mdash;a sense of
being caught&mdash;of having been lured into the
clutches of his foes. He could not speak; at
each tick of the clock he expected to hear
them denounce him.</p>

<p>But they did not; they bowed to him silently
and advanced to the table at the centre
of the room and sat down; Tarleton was
looking straight at him, but gave not the
slightest sign of having recognized him;
Cornwallis had taken up a quill from the
table, and was tapping with it upon the table,
a flickering smile upon his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;You seemed rather disturbed,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>With a powerful effort Tom pulled himself
together; he was caught, but there was no
use in his showing the white feather, he
thought. So he replied, quietly enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must confess to being slightly surprised,
sir. But that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cornwallis&#8217; smile broadened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; chuckled he. &#8220;You did not expect
to meet two British officers, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea whom I was to meet,&#8221; said
the young swamp-rider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; how could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cornwallis tapped the table with the point
of the quill, thoughtfully; now and then his
eyes would wander from Tom&#8217;s face to that
of Tarleton; he seemed to be considering
something very carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought,&#8221; said he at last, &#8220;to meet
a very different person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rather older person, to be sure,&#8221; said
Tarleton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>Tom bent his head slightly, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the commander of the
British army, &#8220;you do not know either of us&mdash;no
more than we know you. It is better
so; the work that you are about to do is of
exceeding peril, and the less we know of each
other, the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom looked at the speaker in astonishment.
However, he did not allow the feeling to show
in his face; they were playing with him, he
fancied; and he suddenly resolved that he
would bear his part in it, and prove that he
was not afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought,&#8221; said he coolly, after a
moment&#8217;s silence, &#8220;that I had met this gentleman,&#8221;
nodding toward Tarleton, &#8220;before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have just come to Charleston, from
Canada,&#8221; said Tarleton. &#8220;How could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression upon the man&#8217;s face as he
said this, puzzled Tom; he seemed to be sincere;
he seemed to mean it; and not the
slightest recollection of having met Tom in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
hand to hand conflict that day in the swamps
was observable in his countenance. What
could it all mean? The lad began to doubt
the evidence of his own senses.</p>

<p>&#8220;How,&#8221; asked Lord Cornwallis, &#8220;is Sir
Henry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Henry?&#8221; Tom looked at him dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Sir Henry Clinton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom recovered, with a slight gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he was quite well when
last I heard of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Cornwallis, &#8220;he does not
write to you very often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; confessed the lad, &#8220;he does not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought that he would neglect it
after a time. He has a short memory at best.
However, since you have arrived here safely
it does not matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You received the list of names which we
sent you?&#8221; inquired Tarleton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; answered Tom, his mind going at
once to the papers which he had received, but
had not understood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;You did not get much information from
them, of course,&#8221; put in Cornwallis, with a
laugh. &#8220;But that was not to be expected;
you must become acquainted with the section
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth was slowly dawning upon the
young scout; these men were not playing
with him as he had supposed. They were
serious; they had mistaken him for another&mdash;for
a person whom they had never seen,
and who was due in Charleston, upon some
mysterious errand, at that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;This department of yours,&#8221; said Tarleton
after a longer pause than usual, &#8220;is something
new, is it not? I have heard that
Chatham was strongly opposed to it, but that
the king&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; Cornwallis laid his hand warningly
upon the other&#8217;s arm. &#8220;That is a thing
not to be spoken of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Tarleton, impatiently,
&#8220;among friends&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even among friends,&#8221; said Cornwallis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
&#8220;silence must be kept.&#8221; He turned to Tom.
&#8220;Is this not so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; answered Tom slowly, for he
feared to betray himself, &#8220;that the utmost
secrecy is considered necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221; Cornwallis looked triumphantly
at the other officer. &#8220;Just what I
have always held since the matter was first
brought to my attention. To hope to do anything
by such means, one must work in the
dark, so to speak&mdash;one must not allow even
a whisper to reach the upper world, if success
is to be hoped for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; and Tom bowed, more mystified
than ever, but determined to carry out
the matter to the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Cornwallis, &#8220;I suppose
you will wish to see the gentleman who is to
give you the information which you seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please.&#8221; The youth said this not
without some misgiving; but he dreaded to
refuse, as it might excite some suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Cornwallis, apparently greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
pleased. &#8220;I had fancied that you&#8217;d not want
to see him until later. But I had him come
here to-night on the chance; I am delighted
that you show a willingness to take the matter
up so promptly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was rather angry with himself for this
same willingness; but it was too late now; so
Cornwallis rang a bell to summon the person
spoken of.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is waiting in the next room,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and I rather think you will find him the
kind of man you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the door opened and Lieutenant
Cheyne of Tarleton&#8217;s horse entered. He
looked at Tom sharply for a moment as he
crossed to the table at which the others were
sitting. But it had been four long years
since the affair of the mansion of Jasper Harwood,
and Tom had greatly changed and
grown since then; so he bore himself with
boldness and confidence and looked straight
into Cheyne&#8217;s eye without a quaver. The
lieutenant, however, was only marveling at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the youth of the visitor who had come there
wrapped about in so much mystery; no
thought of ever having met him before had
crossed his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman,&#8221; said Cornwallis, &#8220;will
introduce you wherever you wish, in Charleston.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be most happy,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the towns and cities further north,&#8221;
proceeded Cornwallis, &#8220;we have provided another
person for that. I will summon him,
also.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand was already upon the bell, but
Tom stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The name of
this person, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other three looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought that no names were to be
mentioned at this stage of the proceedings.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_252.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">
<i>&#8220;THIS GENTLEMAN,&#8221; SAID CORNWALLIS,<br />
&#8220;WILL INTRODUCE YOU&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Tom saw that he had gone a little too far;
but he feared possible recognition, and it
might chance that the man whom the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
commander was about to call in, would know
him; so he continued, boldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Safety is the first thing to be looked after.
I must demand the name of this person, before
you admit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you can suspect no one in Charleston,&#8221;
said Cornwallis in surprise.</p>

<p>Tom determined upon a shrewd stroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;If none were suspected,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I
should not be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words struck home; the three British
officers looked at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Cornwallis, soberly. &#8220;That
fact escaped me for the moment. The gentleman
who is waiting without is Mr. Clarage, a
loyal subject of the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without knowing it the young swamp-rider
had been standing upon the brink of
discovery; for had Clarage once entered the
room he would have been sure to have
recognized him. The look upon Tom&#8217;s face
was observed by Tarleton, and misconstrued.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you do not mean to
say that you refuse Clarage&#8217;s aid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said the youth, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You suspect him!&#8221; Cornwallis uttered
the words in tones of the utmost astonishment.
&#8220;Why, I did not dream that you ever
had heard his name before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard of the gentleman many
times,&#8221; said Tom, gravely.</p>

<p>Once more the three officers stared at one
another, this time apparently astounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not imagined,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel
Tarleton, &#8220;that the ramifications of
the new system were so extensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a certain note of respect in his
voice that did not escape Tom; he had made
an impression by his boldness.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many things connected with
this business,&#8221; said the youth, &#8220;that I don&#8217;t
understand myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not&mdash;I suppose not.&#8221; There
was awe in the voice of Cornwallis as he said
this; and Tom could scarcely keep from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
laughing. He was determined to escape the
notice of Clarage, so he continued,</p>

<p>&#8220;This man Clarage must not be permitted
to observe me&mdash;he must not see me&mdash;he must
not know who I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible that he is suspected as
strongly as all that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not a king&#8217;s officer,&#8221; said Tom,
&#8220;and in these times it behooves us to
suspect every one not actually in the uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; cried Tarleton. &#8220;Right, sir!
Allow me to shake you by the hand.&#8221; He
grasped Tom&#8217;s hand as he spoke, and shook
it warmly. &#8220;When I first clapped eyes upon
you I could not understand why a boy had
been sent about this important business; but
I see it now; it&#8217;s because you have brains and
know how to use them.&#8221; He continued to
shake Tom&#8217;s hand violently. &#8220;I beg your
pardon, sir, for my first impression of you;
but I see my mistake, and am willing to
acknowledge it. You are right. Every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
in Carolina should be suspected except those
who wear the king&#8217;s uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two senior officers talked long
and earnestly about matters of which Tom
had not the slightest knowledge; but, seeing
that he was supposed to be well informed as
to most of it, he kept nodding his head or
shaking it, as the case might be, and wore
a look of great gravity. He gradually drew
from their talk that he was supposed to be a
messenger, sent by the very highest officials
of the government at London, to collect facts
of some kind. But just what the facts were,
and why so much caution was considered
necessary in their collecting, he could not
learn. At length Cornwallis said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is to be an affair to-morrow evening
at which you could meet a very great
many people, if you choose to attend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom trembled with expectation; but his
voice was steady enough, as he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed; and what is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Cheyne&#8217;s wedding; it is Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
eve and he is to marry the ward
of Jasper Harwood, a most excellent gentleman
and a strong advocate of the king&#8217;s government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be most happy to have you come,&#8221;
said Cheyne, bowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to,&#8221; said Tom, returning the
bow, and struggling to hide his eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is to be a sort of Christmas f&ecirc;te at
the same time,&#8221; remarked Lieutenant Cheyne.
&#8220;A mask, you know; it&#8217;s a thing that the
people here do about Christmas time, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! A mask.&#8221; Tom looked thoughtful.
&#8220;But, my dear sir, I think this will
prevent my attending. I have no costume.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No costume,&#8221; broke in Tarleton, with a
loud laugh. &#8220;What is the matter with the
disguise you are wearing now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, true,&#8221; said the youth, coolly. &#8220;Quite
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had my eye upon it for some time,&#8221;
said Tarleton. &#8220;It&#8217;s much the same sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
thing as that scamp Marion and his fellows
wear. But I suppose you adopted it because
you had to pass through the region which
that villain infests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did pass through Marion&#8217;s district&mdash;yes,&#8221;
said the youth, evenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do nicely,&#8221; said Cheyne. &#8220;Indeed
I could imagine nothing better for such an
occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;It is settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to send for you,&#8221; remarked
Cheyne.</p>

<p>Tom considered for a moment. His
thoughts were working upon a plan that had
just flashed into his mind; and then he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; upon consideration it would be best
that I go alone. Where is the wedding to
take place, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Cornwallis. &#8220;You came to
this plantation blindfolded; you could not
find your way here again, alone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>&#8220;I shall leave the place with my eyes
open,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;and shall note its location
as I ride toward the town. And now,&#8221; after
a short pause, &#8220;if we have quite finished, I
shall be on my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have said all that we can say, for the
present,&#8221; said Cornwallis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the young swamp-rider, as he
bowed with dignity to the three British officers,
&#8220;I will bid you good-night, gentlemen,
and trust that we shall meet soon
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sultan was at the door. Tom sprang upon
his back and shook the rein. Then he waved
his hand to the officers on the steps, for they
had followed him with considerable ceremony
through the hall; in a moment he was dashing
along the well-remembered road leading
from his father&#8217;s plantation. He followed the
track toward the city for some time; then
drew rein and listened. There was no sound
on the road behind, no evidence that he was
being followed. Assuring himself of this, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
wheeled Sultan into a narrow road leading
northwest, and went dashing light-heartedly
to meet his comrades at the
Indian&#8217;s Head.</p>

<small>HOW THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENED ON CHRISTMAS
EVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Christmas time, in the year 1780, the
British had no very great occasion for rejoicing,
so far as their affairs of government were
concerned, at least. They were at war with
three European nations&mdash;France, Holland
and Spain; their colonies in North America
were waging a desperate war for independence
that seemed as though it would never end,
and their attempt to gain possession of West
Point, on the Hudson, through the treachery
of the infamous Benedict Arnold, had just
failed.</p>

<p>However, the army under Cornwallis, or at
least the officers, did not seem to take their
country&#8217;s misfortunes very much to heart.
The winter season was long remembered for
its many gaieties; the loyalists of the town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
had thrown open their houses and vied with
each other as to who could do the most for
the king&#8217;s scarlet-coated dandies. And among
them all not one entertained upon the scale
of Jasper Harwood; he seemed determined to
prove his loyalty to the crown by his lavish
expenditures; but in reality, as the reader
knows, he had another reason.</p>

<p>The Harwood place was a large one. Hundreds
of acres of land were planted with cotton
and tobacco; scores of slaves toiled upon
the plantation to enrich their master; his
mules, oxen and horses were very many.
Then, too, he had the Deering place under
cultivation; the slaves upon it already addressed
him as master; the revenues that
came in he appropriated to his own use,
which little piece of knavery the authorities
overlooked in so good a citizen.</p>

<p>His plan to marry his ward Laura to Lieutenant
Cheyne, of Tarleton&#8217;s regiment of horse,
had long been in his mind; but now he was
to carry it into effect. All preparations had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
been made; the Deering mansion, which Harwood
now occupied, it being nearer to the
city than his own, was brilliantly lighted;
the grounds, for the South Carolina December
is not severe, were also brightly illuminated,
and were thronged by large crowds of
guests, all en masque, laughing, chattering
and getting all the enjoyment out of the situation
possible.</p>

<p>The sounds of music, softly played, came
from the mansion; splendidly attired officers
and gorgeously dressed maskers now and then
passed the windows or thronged down the
steps. Here and there was gathered a knot
of the young blades of the army, both foot
and horse, masked, but wearing their uniforms.
They talked and laughed loudly; the
campaign was largely the subject of their conversation,
and they recounted their personal
deeds vaingloriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the louts would only stand and fight,&#8221;
said one youthful, but strapping dragoon.
&#8220;How is a fellow to do anything satisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
when the beggars do nothing but dart in and
out among the swamps like a lot of gnats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said another; &#8220;it is quite
disappointing when one has a body of them
almost in one&#8217;s hand, and then, in a moment&mdash;presto,
they are gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this rascal Marion is the most elusive
of the lot,&#8221; said the first speaker. &#8220;He positively
will not stand up and fight fairly. It&#8217;s
most distressing, when one is going at the
head of a party, along a dark path through
the swamps, to have this fellow, the Swamp-Fox,
as Tarleton has named him, suddenly
spring out from ambush and pour a fire into
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh greeted this complaint; it was
well known to all that the speaker had suffered
in this way not long before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Campbell must have been asleep in his
saddle that night,&#8221; remarked one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then all whom the Swamp-Fox has surprised
have been dozing,&#8221; flared Campbell.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not exactly because of the surprise,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
said the other, &#8220;but what you saw afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if what you told me you saw in the
fight were not the visions of a dream, I&#8217;ll
give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean the black!&#8221; exclaimed the
stalwart young dragoon. &#8220;But he was no
vision; he was a stern reality, as some of my
fellows have cause to remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us about it, Campbell,&#8221; said another.
&#8220;Prove to us that you were not slumbering
upon the occasion spoken of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not much of a story,&#8221; said Campbell,
&#8220;it only shows how startled a man can be by
something out of the ordinary when it comes
upon him suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, awhile back, Tarleton sent me
out with thirty men across the Santee to destroy
some stores that the rebels had been accumulating
on an island in one of the
swamps. I had crossed the river and, as it
was coming on night, was looking for a dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
spot to encamp. Suddenly, without a moment&#8217;s
warning the air was filled with the
crash of rifle and pistol-shots and the most
infernal yelling that I have ever listened to.
Then out from behind bush, thicket, trees and
everything else that could possibly hide a
man, poured the rascally band of this rebel,
Marion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing extraordinary in that, that I can
see,&#8221; said the young officer who had asked
for the story. &#8220;As you have just said yourself
a moment ago, it&#8217;s a favorite device of the
Swamp-Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; said Campbell, with a
wave of the hand. &#8220;I have not yet reached
the point of my narrative. When the ambuscade
broke cover there rushed upon me a
giant negro. He looked,&#8221; and the young
dragoon gazed about him, &#8220;he looked about
the thickness of that big cottonwood; I am
tall, but he simply towered above me as
though I were a dwarf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Campbell&#8217;s eyes were magnifying that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
night,&#8221; cried one, amid a burst of laughter
from his companions. &#8220;He saw giants&mdash;possibly
it was the genius of the swamp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may laugh,&#8221; protested Campbell,
&#8220;that is what Blake did when I first told
him. But it&#8217;s a fact, I tell you. When he
rushed at me it would have gone hard with
me had it not been for Sergeant Humphries,
who took the first sweep of the black&#8217;s sabre
upon his own. Humphries is no boy in
weight, but, gentlemen, the force of the blow
almost knocked him from the saddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Campbell was speaking, Mark Harwood,
who formed one of the party, had been
listening eagerly. Now he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice,&#8221; he asked of Campbell,
&#8220;a companion with this giant negro?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Harwood,&#8221; laughed the strapping
young dragoon, &#8220;he had a great many
companions. We went flying, helter-skelter,
through the swamp, with the whole lot of them
hot at our heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I mean, was there not a person&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
young man of about my age, but more of your
size&mdash;whom the negro stuck to a great deal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Campbell looked thoughtfully at the
speaker for a moment, then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, there was. It seemed
a great deal like master and man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that,&#8221; cried Mark Harwood, &#8220;was
exactly what they were. The white youth
was my rebel cousin, Tom Deering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cousin,&#8221; said Campbell, surprised.
&#8220;Well, if that is so, you have for a cousin
one of the most remarkable masters of the
sabre that it has ever been my lot to see.
Gentlemen,&#8221; turning to the others, &#8220;the way
that lad handled his weapon. It was marvelous.
The blade seemed to be a thing of
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young officers forming the group
seemed disposed to laugh at this also; for
Ensign Campbell&#8217;s experiences upon the night
in question had long formed a subject for
the exercise of wit. But Mark Harwood
spoke again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest desire to praise
Tom Deering, gentlemen,&#8221; said he, bitterly,
&#8220;but what Campbell says is so. This rebel is
a most remarkable swordsman. It was he, in
the end assisted by this same giant slave, who
kept the staircase against a party of loyalist
gentlemen some time since.&#8221;</p>

<p>An immediate hush fell upon the group;
they had heard of this exploit and had marveled
at it. Maskers in various splendid or
grotesque costumes strolled about the grounds
chattering and laughing at the antics of those
who had most given themselves up to the
spirit of the occasion. About the time Campbell
began to tell his story of the black
giant, a masker, attired as a Carolinian backwoodsman,
had paused near them and, as he
listened, stood leaning against a tree. He
wore a black mask upon the upper part of his
face; a heavy sabre was hanging at his side,
and he carried a rifle in his hands. His
dress was an unusual one, and hardly the
thing to be chosen in Charleston at that time;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
for it was of the kind worn by those who
were in arms against the king.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to the slight surprise of a
great many who noted the fact, there seemed
to be men in much the same costume, and all
wearing black masks, scattered about the
grounds. They did not seem to mingle with
any of the other merrymakers, neither did
they seem to be acquainted with one another.</p>

<p>The woodsman who stood near to the
spot where the British officers were gathered
seemed desirous of attracting no attention; he
stood very quietly, listening, but never once
venturing to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; spoke the man whom Campbell
had addressed as Blake, &#8220;we have heard of
that little affair of the staircase. It took
place at the Foster plantation, did it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Mark Harwood. &#8220;A nest
of traitors to the king which I had long
striven to break up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The family consisted of one half-grown
girl and her father, who was an invalid,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Ensign Campbell, quietly. &#8220;Not a very desperate
gathering of partisans, one would think.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was greeted by a slight laugh. Cold
looks were directed at Mark; the Tories were
little liked by the British soldiery; they felt
that contempt for them which is bound to
arise in the breasts of brave men against those
who prove false to their own kind. And
among all the loyalists in Charleston Mark
Harwood was liked the least; his sly, cunning
manner and his mirthless smile made
him hated among the frank young soldiers
of the king&#8217;s forces; they avoided his company
as much as possible, but, of course, to-night
they could not but tolerate him.</p>

<p>Mark felt the sting which the quiet words
of young Campbell contained and a dark
flush stained his cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the weakest who are ever the worst,&#8221;
cried he, noticing the cold glances of dislike
leveled at him. &#8220;A man like Foster could
do as much harm to the cause of the king as
Marion himself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; said Blake, bitingly. &#8220;But
there is much more credit in matching oneself
against Marion; he, at least, can fight back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark bit his lip savagely at this; he felt
the hostility which some of his actions had
awakened, now and then; but he could never
be made to see the shame of them. His was
a mind which recognized no law of right or
wrong or fairness where a foe was concerned.
It did not matter much to him who or what
the foe was, he would set about crushing him
as completely as possible; if he were weak it
made Harwood all the more resolved, for, as
Lieutenant Blake had insinuated, a weak foe
could not fight back, and hard fighting was a
thing which Master Mark had not much
stomach for.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have frequently noticed, Harwood,&#8221; said
Ensign Campbell, &#8220;that you always select
some such object as Foster for your attacks,
when you are left to your own devices.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark turned upon the young dragoon with
a snarl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;You have a reputation, I believe, Campbell,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;for frequently noticing nonexistent
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean by that, I suppose,&#8221; said the
other, composedly, but with a warning sparkle
in his eye, &#8220;that I am given to stating what
is not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark caught the look in the dragoon&#8217;s eyes;
at any other time it would have frightened
him; but now he was filled with the recklessness
of rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And another thing,&#8221; said he viciously,
&#8220;you yourself admit that you fled before the
sword of Tom Deering that night in the
swamp; and yet you, almost in so many
words, accuse me of cowardice&mdash;I who faced
him that day at Foster&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You faced him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I!&#8221; Mark&#8217;s face was livid with
passion; he knew that these men held his
personal courage in contempt, and he had a
sort of mad desire to convince them that he
was equal to themselves in that respect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
&#8220;Fannin and Clarage will support me in
this,&#8221; he continued, knowing that he could
depend upon the support of these worthies in
anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Campbell, in a changed tone,
&#8220;if you successfully faced this wonderful
swordsman I beg your pardon, for anything
that I may have said or hinted at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not hold his ground long when I
sprang up the steps, I assure you,&#8221; cried
Mark, delighted at the impression which he
had created. He at once plunged into a
glowing account of what had occurred&mdash;colored
to suit himself, of course; but he had
not spoken a dozen words when a hand was
laid on his shoulder, and turning he found
himself gazing into a pair of clear gray eyes
which looked at him from out the holes of a
black mask.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Tom Deering,
quietly, for the masker was he, &#8220;but will you
kindly repeat what you have said.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Mark shook himself free of the clutch upon
his shoulder and returned, angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, sir? I do not know you.
I am speaking to these gentlemen, and am
not addressing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once more I beg your pardon.&#8221; Tom&#8217;s
voice was still quiet. &#8220;But your statement
to these gentlemen,&#8221; bowing to the young officers,
&#8220;was what made me interrupt you. I
know something of the affair at Foster&#8217;s, and
would like to correct what you have mis-stated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark trembled with mingled rage and apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Campbell, in a low voice to
Blake, &#8220;our friend here seems able to put a
spoke in Harwood&#8217;s wheel. This is most interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; said Mark, once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who I am does not matter,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he now ignored Mark, &#8220;I have
met some of those who bore Mr. Harwood
company upon that day, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>&#8220;And they told you the facts of the case,&#8221;
cried Lieutenant Blake, anxious to see Mark
humiliated. &#8220;Come, out with it; let us hear
what you have to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have merely this to say. Mark Harwood
did not once have the manhood to place himself
within the reach of his cousin&#8217;s sabre.
He spent his time upon the outskirts of the
throng, and his part in the affray consisted
entirely of shouting directions to braver men
than himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A score of cold, contemptuous eyes turned
themselves upon Mark; the scorn they felt
for him was unmistakable. Mark, quivering
with passion, turned upon Tom, his hand raised
to strike&mdash;but the next instant he was measuring
his length upon the ground, and Tom
had vanished amidst the quickly gathering
crowd.</p>

<p>The rooms of the Deering mansion were
large ones, but the brilliant gathering to-night
completely filled them. It was a strange feeling
for the young swamp-rider, a half hour or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
so after his experience with Mark, to stand a
stranger&mdash;unknown&mdash;in his own home.</p>

<p>The crowd had begun to press into the
house, for the hour had arrived when Laura
was to be made the unwilling wife of Lieutenant
Cheyne. Tom would have given anything
for a word with her, for Laura had
been his mother&#8217;s favorite niece, and was a
good, brave-hearted girl whom he had always
been proud of. But, though he had sought
everywhere, he could not catch even a glimpse
of her.</p>

<p>However, as he stood by the door leading
to the main hall, there came a sudden stir
among the ladies. A party had just come in;
splendidly attired women, officers glittering
with orders and gold lace, gentlemen of civil
life in powdered wigs and frills starched to a
snowy whiteness. And in the midst of them
was Laura, looking sad and red-eyed with
weeping.</p>

<p>Tom started forward, but the thronging
crowd was too great and he was forced back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
to the quiet spot near the door which he had
occupied before. And, as fate willed it, in a
few moments poor Laura, who had crept out
of the chattering, laughing, exclaiming crush
to cry, stood at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laura,&#8221; said he eagerly. &#8220;Laura.&#8221; His
tone was low, but the sound reached her;
and she looked at him, frightened and surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laura,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Tom,&#8221; whispered she, delight
mixed with fear. &#8220;Oh, what are you doing
here? You have placed yourself in great
danger; why did you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to ask you if this, which is to take
place here to-night, is with your free will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura did not answer, but sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it is not,&#8221; proceeded Tom in the
same low voice. &#8220;Laura, my mother always
thought as much of you as if you had been
her own daughter. And I will do and dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
for you what I would do and dare for my
own sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had no chance to answer, for at this
moment Jasper Harwood came hastily up and,
with a searching, suspicious look at Tom,
drew Laura away. Lieutenant Cheyne had
come in accompanied by a crowd of young
officers; Tarleton and Lord Cornwallis glittered
among the gathering in their splendid
uniforms; not a thing was wanting, in Tory
Harwood&#8217;s mind, to make the occasion one of
the utmost pomp and display.</p>

<p>The burly old Tory stood, with Laura, in
the midst of his glittering guests.</p>

<p>This ceremony was all that was needed to
place the Deering plantation well within his
possession, and the thought filled him with
great satisfaction. Some, in the mansion&#8217;s
great rooms, had removed their masks, but
most had not; and, among others the numerous
body of maskers in the costumes of backwoodsmen,
who had grouped in a solid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
mass near the door, still kept their faces
covered.</p>

<p>The music was playing softly as Harwood
raised his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Cheyne,&#8221; said he, &#8220;come this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cheyne stepped forward, but to
the surprise of all he was shouldered aside
by a rough-looking youth in a black mask.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now, sir!&#8221; exclaimed Cheyne,
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand aside,&#8221; said Tom Deering, sharply.
He pushed his way to the centre of the room,
all falling back in surprise; Cornwallis and
Tarleton, from the far end of the room, had
recognized him as their mysterious visitor of
the night before, and were staring eagerly to
see what he was about to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by this offensive conduct,
sir?&#8221; demanded Jasper Harwood, his
face growing a deep purple and his wicked
little eyes snapping with anger. &#8220;This is my
house and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold,&#8221; cried Tom in a voice that rang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
through the room like the blast of a bugle.
&#8220;You speak falsely, Jasper Harwood. I am
master here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Master!&#8221; Harwood started and a shade
of pallor crept into his face. &#8220;What do you
want here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To take this poor girl, and place her
among friends,&#8221; he pointed to Laura as he
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I, her uncle, not her friend?&#8221; Jasper
Harwood advanced upon Tom, but the masked
young swamp-rider looked him fearlessly in
the eye. &#8220;Who are you, sir?&#8221; the older man
demanded, furiously, &#8220;who are you, I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom turned and held up his hand with a
proud gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand out, my gallant lads,&#8221; he cried, his
eye flashing.</p>

<p>The masks were torn from the faces of the
backwoodsmen, and they stood forth with
musket, pistol and naked sabre, facing the
startled guests of Jasper Harwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;These!&#8221; cried Tom, his glance sweeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
the brilliant throng of officers who stood, their
swords half drawn, looking at him astounded,
&#8220;these are Marion&#8217;s men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; shouted Jasper Harwood.</p>

<p>Tom plucked the covering from his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>As Jasper Harwood looked into his gallant
nephew&#8217;s face, there came a sudden crash of
falling metal; the great candellabrum, which
had been the sole means of lighting the room,
had been dashed to the floor by Cole, and the
place was left in complete darkness. Women
screamed and men shouted; but when
lights were once more secured, the swamp-riders,
with Laura in their midst, were gone;
and the hoof-beats of their horses rang out
from far down the road.</p>

<small>HOW THE BRITISH LOST SOME PRISONERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> the road, like the wind, raced the
band of Marion&#8217;s men; Laura, under escort of
Nat and David Collins, rode well ahead, as
Tom knew that they would not meet any of
the enemy in that direction. The road
skirted the bay, and from across the quiet
waters could be seen the lights of the British
ships.</p>

<p>Tom had expected pursuit to be hotly
made, but to his surprise there was no evidence
of it. A little reflection told him the
reason for this. The plantation was a considerable
distance below the city, and the officers
attending the masque had, for the most
part, come in carriages. Therefore no chargers
were available for a chase, at least not
sufficient to mount a force capable of coping
with our adventurers. No sound was heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
by Tom or Cole, who rode behind, alert for
anything that might happen; the ringing
hoof-beats of their own party were the only
noises that disturbed the silence.</p>

<p>But, at length, even this ceased; the cavalcade
had been brought to a sudden halt, and
Tom and Cole rode forward to learn the cause
of it. Nat and Dave Collins were waiting for
him; Laura, patting her pawing horse&#8217;s neck,
was beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;As we rounded the bend in the road,&#8221;
said David Collins, &#8220;I thought I saw a sudden
gleam of light from the water, close to
shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw it, too,&#8221; said Nat, his brother. &#8220;It
seemed as though it was from a boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in a boat,&#8221; put in Laura. &#8220;I saw
it plainly. And the boat was full of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remain where you are,&#8221; directed Tom.
&#8220;Nat, I leave you in charge. Dave, you and
Cole come with me; we&#8217;ll see what all this
means. It may be a boat&#8217;s crew from one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
the vessels of war which has been somehow
signaled that we are coming by this road.&#8221;</p>

<p>They left their horses in care of their comrades
and cautiously advanced; as they
neared the beach they could hear the water
lapping on the sand&mdash;yes, and now they
caught the undoubted murmur of voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to put the boats&#8217; noses up on
the beach and wait for them,&#8221; said a voice.</p>

<p>Tom nudged his companions and they returned
it. &#8220;Without question,&#8221; they thought,
&#8220;they have been warned, and are waiting for
us to put in an appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expected them to pass, long before this,&#8221;
spoke another voice, &#8220;and keel haul me if I
understand the delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, give them time,&#8221; said the first
speaker, &#8220;we have all night before us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, souse my tops if we have; the tide
changes at two o&#8217;clock, and we want to take
advantage of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here followed the sound of keels grating
upon the sand. Through the gloom Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
could discern two large boats, in each of
which were a half dozen men, armed to the
teeth. Somehow, the voice of the last speaker
sounded strangely familiar; Tom, who, like
his two companions, lay flat upon the sand,
crawled forward for a space in order that he
might obtain a better view. As it chanced,
in his path were a quantity of dry shells; and
as he drew himself over these, they made a
crackling noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that!&#8221; whispered one of the men
in the boat nearest Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear a sound from the beach
over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh followed this.</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought you heard hoofs awhile
ago,&#8221; said the second voice, from the other
boat. &#8220;It&#8217;s all your imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tar my old rigging!&#8221; cried the other,
obstinately. &#8220;I heard something just then,
and I&#8217;m going to see what it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker leaped out upon the sand, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
cutlass in his right hand and a lantern in his
left. He slowly advanced, his lantern flashing
this way and that, until at last its rays
rested upon a bronzed, youthful, smiling face
gazing calmly, from the sand, into his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom Deering,&#8221; he almost shouted, his
eyes wide with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Dick!&#8221; cried Tom in return, and
in a moment he had sprung to his feet and
gripped the old sea-dog in a hug like that of
a cinnamon bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, lad, easy!&#8221; gasped Uncle Dick.
&#8220;If you grip me any tighter you&#8217;ll smash my
hull and bring the masts by the board.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wrung his nephew&#8217;s hand warmly, his
weather-beaten face all wrinkled with smiles,
his long gray cue almost bristling from pure
joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were one of the enemy&#8217;s
spies,&#8221; said he at last after he had greeted the
grinning Cole, and had had Nat presented
to him. &#8220;But what in old Neptune brings
you here? Tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>In a few moments Tom had acquainted him
with the facts of his expedition to Charleston.
The old man wrung his hand once more as he
finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brave boy,&#8221; cried he, delighted beyond
measure. &#8220;So you saved Laura from that
swab, Harwood, did you! Well, you&#8217;ll never
do a better thing in your life! And you
have a company of friends back there a piece,
did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there are a round score of us, all told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not too much done up to take a
hand in another little enterprise before the
night&#8217;s over, eh, lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; cried the young scout, eagerly. &#8220;I
can speak for all my friends, I know. What
is it, Uncle Dick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down there,&#8221; and the old seaman pointed
to the water&#8217;s edge, &#8220;I have two boats, and in
them is the biggest part of the crew of the
four-gun schooner, Defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your schooner was not taken by the
enemy when they captured Charleston!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>&#8220;Nothing like it. And she&#8217;s been doing
good work for Congress ever since, even if I
do say it myself. But, to come back to the
present: Some time ago I learned that your
father was still held a prisoner in the hulks
there,&#8221; pointing to some heavy, unpainted
and unseaworthy craft that were anchored off
a sandy headland and whose lights could be
plainly seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father!&#8221; There was a sharp note of
pain in Tom&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Then he has not been
sent to the English prisons; he has been detained
here in one of those hulks all this time,
as I supposed. What a fate!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad would have broken down had not
Captain Deering made haste to reassure him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, boy! don&#8217;t take it so hard.
He&#8217;s done very well, considering. The party
who brought me the news of him says he&#8217;s in
good health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if that be so,&#8221; broke in Tom, his
eyes burning as they fastened themselves
upon the hulks, &#8220;even if that be so, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
long can it last? If he remains there he will
break down both in health and spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not be there long,&#8221; said Uncle Dick,
quietly.</p>

<p>Tom looked at him quickly, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that,&#8221; seizing
his uncle by the arm; &#8220;do you mean
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just exactly what I do mean,&#8221;
said the seaman. &#8220;Inside of an hour your
father is to be transferred from the hulk in
which he is held prisoner to the frigate Benbow,
which you see lying over there,&#8221; pointing
to the vessel of war nearest the shore.
&#8220;She is to sail to-morrow for England, and
Lord North has issued orders for the captain
to bring your father and some other wealthy
prisoners with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Tom, his voice husky with
anxiety. &#8220;And your plan is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To attack the boat that carries them from
the hulk to the frigate. I have, as I said before,
almost the entire crew of the Defence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
here in her pinnace and gig; and each man
of them is armed for desperate work. There
is room in the boats for some of your friends
if they care to join us in this little affair; we
cannot have too many, as there is no knowing
what sized crew will man the boat; and with,
perhaps, a marine or two for good measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom despatched Cole back to bring up the
remainder of his band; and when they advanced
and learned what was going forward
they, to a man, volunteered to help. The
first thing to do was to see to Laura&#8217;s safety;
Captain Deering sent one of his men for a
fisherman&#8217;s yawl which he knew was drawn
up on the sand a short distance below. The
fisherman was an ex-member of the Defence&#8217;s
crew and a stout friend of his old captain; so
when he and one of his grown sons appeared
with the yawl he readily agreed to row Laura
to the schooner, the whereabouts of which
was carefully explained to him.</p>

<p>Tom, after the boat containing the girl and
the two friendly fishermen had pulled away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
in the direction of the schooner, detailed two
of his men to lead the horses to a point some
miles below on the shores of the bay. Then
he and the others placed themselves under
the orders of Captain Deering and his first
mate, who was in command of the second boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, lads,&#8221; spoke the skipper of the Defence,
&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s no use telling you
that you are bound on a dangerous cruise&mdash;not
a very long one, but such a one as will
need us to keep the starboard and larboard
watch both on deck all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Douse the lantern!&#8221; said the mate, gruffly.
He was a thick-set, hardy looking man, about
his captain&#8217;s age; he had an eye like a hawk
and a way of casting it about every now and
then that at once dubbed him sailor. The
captain instantly blew out the lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything moving, Mr. Jackson?&#8221; asked
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard a creaking of blocks from the
hulks,&#8221; returned the mate. &#8220;They are lowering
the boat, skipper, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d best be afloat!&#8221; exclaimed
Captain Deering. &#8220;Tumble in, my hearties,
and push off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors of the Defence and the swamp-riders
were soon evenly distributed between
the gig and the pinnace; the former was under
the command of Captain Deering in person,
and in the bows sat Tom and Cole; Nat
and David Collins were in the mate&#8217;s boat;
all were silent as the boats shoved off from
the beach; the lapping of the water against
their sides and the long, soft strokes of the
oars were the only sounds that could be
heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve launched a boat,&#8221; said the mate
in a low tone. The gig and pinnace still
pulled side by side, a double length of oar
between them. &#8220;Yes, and there goes another
one, and another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stiff work,&#8221; growled the captain, as he
strove to follow the mate&#8217;s pointing finger.
&#8220;I can just about make them out, Mr. Jackson,
and they seem to be full of men.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope they&#8217;re mostly prisoners,&#8221; said
the mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have your cutlasses ready, men,&#8221; said
Captain Deering, softly. &#8220;We can&#8217;t use the
pistol until we&#8217;re sure of where we are firing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three boats had pushed off from the
hulk by this time; one was a galley, pulled
by at least a dozen men and carrying as many
marines in her bow, another was a small
jolly-boat, and the last a ship&#8217;s gig in the
stern of which were to be seen several officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother the galley,&#8221; said Uncle
Dick. &#8220;It holds only a guard. The prisoners
are in the gig or the small boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seem to be only three of them,&#8221;
said Tom, straining his eyes through the
darkness. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t make out my father
among them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s there, fast enough,&#8221; said the captain,
encouragingly.</p>

<p>The pinnace and gig lay directly in the
paths of the advancing boats; Captain Deering
had given orders to cease rowing, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
they lay silently upon the water, rising and
falling with the slight swell. The others had
not yet seen them, for they showed no lights,
but kept swinging steadily along with their
sweeps. The galley was first and the skipper
passed the word, hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to give her a volley, after all.
Ready, lads, and shoot low.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken the words when a
marine in the bow of the approaching galley
discovered them and gave the alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull hard,&#8221; roared Captain Deering. The
oarsmen obeyed, and the gig shot forward.
The swamp-riders knelt or stood in the bow,
their muskets ready. &#8220;Fire,&#8221; cried the
skipper of the Defence.</p>

<p>A shower of musket balls swept into the
galley; the marines in her were too surprised
to make a quick recovery; but their officers
were shouting angry commands and hot
words of reproof at them, and they at last
succeeded in discharging their pieces in a
half-hearted way; but before they could reload<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the gig of the Defence was alongside
them, and cutlass and sabre were at their
deadly work. Tom fought with desperation;
the galley must be beaten off before he could
hope to get alongside the British gig, which
held the prisoners. But the marines had recovered
from their surprise by this time and
were battling determinedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must end this,&#8221; Tom heard Captain
Deering growl, &#8220;the gig is pulling away to
save the prisoners.&#8221; The old sea-dog was
slashing right and left with a cutlass as he
spoke, with Tom and Cole at his side. Back
and forth they swayed; the gunwales of the
gig and galley ground together, the sword-blades
flashed up and down; the pistols
barked gruffly through the din of shouts and
the clash of steel on steel.</p>

<p>Cole had lost his sabre overboard, and,
clutching his rifle-barrel with both hands, was
doing frightful execution among the enemy
with the brass-bound butt. At the words of
Captain Deering, the giant slave&#8217;s eyes darted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
toward the British gig; its seamen were pulling
lustily toward the frigate, its officers urging
them to increased exertion with every
stroke. Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation Cole
sprang into the galley, clearing a space before
him with his clubbed musket. Then once,
twice, thrice the heavy butt of the weapon
rose and fell; there was a splintering of wood,
a sudden shout of rage and fear, and the
galley, her bottom stove in, sank in the waters
of the bay.</p>

<p>As she went down Cole clutched at the
stern of the gig and was hauled on board by
Tom and the skipper. The latter, as cool
and collected as though he sat on his own
after-deck, gave the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give way, lads; and pull hearty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gig bounded through the waters like
a thing of life; the creaming waters were
dashed from her sharp bow; the men pulled
with skill and good will, and Tom noted, as
he stood in the bow, that they gained upon
the British boat. The pinnace, under Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
Johnson, had grappled with the galley on the
other side, and had not cleared the wreck so
quickly. But she now was bounding after
the gig under the impulse of her crew&#8217;s
brawny arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going to reach safety under the
frigate&#8217;s guns before we overhaul them,&#8221; said
Captain Deering. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s hopeless,
lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Tom, desperately; &#8220;don&#8217;t
give up the chase. I&#8217;ll reduce their speed a
trifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up his rifle as he spoke, placed
it to his shoulder, ran his eye along the barrel
and pulled the trigger. A cry came from the
flying boat; one of the oarsmen dropped his
sweep and tumbled into the bottom. This, of
course, caused much confusion; the wounded
man was dragged forward and another man
took his place. But the gig of the Defence
had made a clear gain upon them of fifty yards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lad!&#8221; cried the captain. &#8220;Try it
again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>Tom did not stop to reload his rifle, but
picked up one belonging to one of his companions.
He leveled the piece with great
care. Once more the shot rang out, and once
more an oarsman fell. The British officers in
the stern now began firing, but as they did
not take careful aim their shots did no harm.
By this time, however, those on board the
frigate had received the alarm; lanterns
flashed upon her decks and a drum rolled
sullenly. The boat containing the prisoners
was almost within range of her guns when
the gig of the Defence overhauled her.</p>

<p>They grappled instantly and the fight raged
with the utmost fury. Without a moment&#8217;s
hesitation Tom, followed by Cole, sprang into
the enemy&#8217;s boat among the cutlasses and
pistols of the British tars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I am here! I have
come to save you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he could not pause to look about, for
the enemy had flown at him with great determination.
Shrieks of pain and shouts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
rage mingled with the clash of steel and the
spiteful explosions of the firearms. But in
the heat of the conflict the pinnace with
Mr. Johnson and his crew arrived, and in a
very few moments the British sailors were
forced to surrender their arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; cried Tom, his tones full of joy,
&#8220;the prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>A number of white, worn-looking patriots
were helped into the gig. Tom&#8217;s heart sank
when he looked at them. His father was not
among them!</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these all the prisoners?&#8221; he cried,
addressing one of the white-faced men who
sat in the stern of the Defence&#8217;s gig. &#8220;Was
there not another named Deering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; returned the man.</p>

<p>Tom, with despair in his eyes turned to the
British officers in the other boat. With one
accord they burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed one; &#8220;so it was he that
you were after. Well, you&#8217;ve failed, for you
attacked the wrong boat.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>&#8220;He was not in the galley,&#8221; gasped Tom,
his face going white.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he was in the jolly-boat.&#8221; The
speaker pointed to a dark speck alongside the
frigate. &#8220;See, there she is; she has made
safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is there,&#8221; shouted Tom to Captain
Deering. &#8220;Pull for the frigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said the old sailor quietly.
Then he gave the word to shove off.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going to desert him!&#8221; Tom
was beside himself. &#8220;You are not going to
leave him behind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give way,&#8221; ordered Captain Deering.</p>

<p>The men bent to their oars, and the gig
bounded over the short waves, putting more
and more water between them and the frigate
at every stroke. Mr. Johnson had issued the
same command and the bow of the pinnace
was but a few yards from the gig&#8217;s stern.
Tom&#8217;s burning eyes were fixed upon the frigate;
somewhere in the dark loom of its hull
was his father&mdash;the father whom he so longed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
to see and whom he had vowed to liberate.
Each stroke of the oars that carried him from
him cut him like a knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;One dash,&#8221; he implored his uncle. &#8220;One
swift dash and we can save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The frigate has lowered her boats,&#8221; said
the skipper of the Defence. &#8220;It would be
certain death to attempt it.&#8221; Then to the
sailors he cried encouragingly, &#8220;Pull hard,
my lads, show the British what American
muscle can do!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boats shot away under the compelling
force of the sturdy arms at the oars.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good four knots to the schooner,&#8221;
said the mate, from the pinnace. &#8220;And their
men are fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was true; for a long time the men
bent to their oars, but the schooner was still
too far off to be seen, while the steady stroke
of the frigate&#8217;s boats could be heard astern in
the darkness, each moment growing nearer.
And the other war vessels in the bay had
sounded the alarm by this time; signal rockets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
were flaring across the sky, and the light
of lanterns was to be seen on every hand,
while the throbbing of drums was faintly
borne to their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like desperate work,&#8221; said the captain.
His tones were grave and his eyes were
straining through the gloom. &#8220;Oh, if we
only stood on the decks of the old schooner I
would not care for them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though in answer to his words Tom
suddenly sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; shouted he. &#8220;Look there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Defence!&#8221; exclaimed the skipper,
joy in his voice, &#8220;and bearing down to hunt
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a great bird the schooner loomed up
through the darkness; her mainsail, topsails
and jib were set and bellying to the breeze;
the ripple of the water at her foot could be
plainly heard, for she was almost upon them
when Tom discovered her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahoy!&#8221; shouted the skipper. &#8220;Schooner,
ahoy!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>A prompt response came from the Defence&#8217;s
deck; she swept about with the grace of a
hawk; and all hands were soon on board and
the gig and pinnace swung up after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make all sail,&#8221; said Captain Deering to
Mr. Johnson. The mate&#8217;s deep tones rang
through the schooner; blocks creaked, ropes
were manned, and seamen swarmed into the
rigging. Then like a great, white ghost the
Defence fell into the breeze and swept out of
the harbor, leaving the pursuing boats to return
to the frigate with the news of the
prisoners&#8217; escape.</p>

<p>As Tom leaned on the quarter-rail and
gazed eagerly back over the schooner&#8217;s white
track he felt a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, lad, forgive me,&#8221; said his Uncle
Dick; &#8220;you see for yourself, don&#8217;t you, that
it was useless to go nearer the frigate?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom gripped his uncle&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you were right, of course, uncle. But
it&#8217;s pretty hard to have been so near, and,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>He could not finish the sentence, but turned
away abruptly, and for many a day Tom
had a heavy heart.</p>

<small>HOW TOM DEERING FOUGHT HIS FIRST FIGHT
UPON THE SEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the schooner was well beyond pursuit
she dropped in close to shore, and word
was sent to the men who guarded the horses
to take them back to Marion&#8217;s camp. Then
the vessel got under way once more; it was
no time to loiter, as the frigates might make
sail after them at any time.</p>

<p>Tom, sick at heart at his failure to rescue
his father, had decided to stick to the Defence
until he saw Laura at least in safety somewhere;
and several others of his command
were delighted at the prospects of a cruise upon
deep water. Next morning Tom approached
his uncle upon the subject of Laura.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been running out of the port of
Baltimore,&#8221; said Captain Deering, &#8220;for a long
time, and we have some folks at Baltimore.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
You don&#8217;t remember your Uncle Ben&#8217;s family,
I suppose? I&#8217;ve been to see them once or
twice during the last year, and a fine, healthy
lot of boys and girls they are, and Ben and
his wife are as hearty as can be. Suppose I
run up the Chesapeake, and have Laura stop
with them for awhile?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent idea,&#8221; said Tom, much relieved.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m glad you thought of it,
for Laura&#8217;s safety has been troubling me a
great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The run along the coast up to the Chesapeake
was enlivened by a number of chases
by British vessels; there was one, a sloop-of-war,
of about the same tonnage as the Defence
and carrying not many more guns, which
Captain Deering ran from with great regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to train Long Tom on her,&#8221; said the
old sea-dog, patting the long pivot gun, amidships;
&#8220;but as I&#8217;ve got Laura on board, I
suppose I must show the sloop a clean pair of
heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached Baltimore, after a narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
escape from a brig and two fleet schooners
which were cruising up and down at the
mouth of the bay, Tom and the captain saw
Laura safely housed with Uncle Ben, who
was delighted to receive her; then, after many
&#8220;good-byes&#8221; they once more sought the Defence.</p>

<p>As it happened the harbor of Baltimore
was in great commotion just about that time;
a great fleet of merchantmen, fifty sail in all,
were waiting for a chance to sail, but the British
fleet outside kept up such a vigilant watch
that it seemed as though the time would never
come. A brave and resolute officer, Captain
Murray, who had at one time served in the
land force and afterward in the infant navy,
was engaged by the merchants of the port for
the post of commodore of the fleet.</p>

<p>His personal charge was a &#8220;letter of
marque,&#8221; the Revenge, carrying a crew of
fifty men and eighteen guns. A few days before,
Captain Murray had signaled the fleet to
make sail; but upon venturing into open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
water he had encountered a greatly superior
force and was compelled with his entire fleet
to run up the Patuxent for safety.</p>

<p>However, he had now received word that
the enemy, grown tired of waiting, had sailed,
and he was making ready for another attempt.
Knowing that the Defence had lately
entered the port he paid her a visit next
morning in his gig.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Deering, I believe,&#8221; said the commander
of the letter of marque.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the old sailor, who stood in
the waist, overlooking some repairs to the topsails,
which had been badly torn by a discharge
of small shot from one of the British
vessels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Captain Murray, of the Revenge,&#8221;
said the visitor. &#8220;The fleet which you see in
the harbor is about to sail to-morrow; I have
come to you to know how conditions are outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be plenty of the enemy&#8217;s
craft,&#8221; grinned Captain Deering, &#8220;and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
are mighty liberal with their shot, for witness
of which look at my topsails,&#8221; and he waved
his horny hand toward the rent canvas
which some of the sailors were stitching and
patching as they sat with their backs to the
bulwarks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been asking for delay,&#8221; said Captain
Murray; &#8220;but the merchants want their cargoes
afloat, and will listen to nothing else but
immediate sailing orders, they having heard
that the enemy had sailed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what they are,&#8221; said the skipper
of the Defence. &#8220;These land-lubbers are
never satisfied. If their old tubs are held
back they rave and tear; and if they are
taken out in the face of the enemy and are
captured or sunk they go on worse than before.
Tar my old hull, captain, there&#8217;s no
way of pleasing such swabs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;ve been in some such position as
mine yourself,&#8221; said Captain Murray.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; returned Captain Deering. &#8220;I
convoyed a fleet out of Charleston before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
British took the town. They gave me no
peace till I got their old hookers out; and
then when the enemy bore down on us, six
sail strong and mounting as many guns as I
had men, they scuttled here and there like
a lot of ducks in a rain-storm. Result was
that about half of &#8217;em was seized; and of
course when I ran back with the others the
entire blame was put upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said the captain of the letter of
marque. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that is how it is going
to be with me. When do you sail, Captain
Deering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the next tide,&#8221; answered the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you be prevailed upon to sail with
the fleet?&#8221; inquired the other anxiously. The
trim look of the Defence, the bright, well-kept
guns and the brisk businesslike crew
had taken his fancy. The schooner would be
no mean addition to his fighting force, and he
awaited the answer with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the fleet,&#8221; said Captain Deering, &#8220;sails
when I do, and means to stand to its guns if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
the enemy is sighted, I&#8217;ll stick by you while
I have a shot in the locker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; said Captain Murray gratefully.
&#8220;There is to be a meeting of the captains,
upon the Revenge, this morning. We
are going to arrange matters before sailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, although the merchant fleet numbered
fifty sail and some of them were large
vessels, very few of them carried guns. It
was plain, therefore, that even this great collection
of craft would be comparatively helpless
under the fire of a few light, well armed,
fast sailing vessels of the enemy. It was to
effect some sort of a system of defence that the
commodore had called the captains together,
and the meeting upon the Revenge ended in
terms of agreement being entered into by the
armed ships, to support one another in case
of attack. Signals were agreed upon for the
entire fleet, and then all retired to their respective
vessels to await the turning of the
tide.</p>

<p>In the gray of the morning the boatman&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
whistle sounded through the Defence; all
hands turned out to up anchor and make sail.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will be our first experience at deep-water
fighting,&#8221; said Tom to Nat Collins as
they, with the remainder of the swamp-riders&#8217;
band, stood in the stern, ready to lend a hand
when required.</p>

<p>&#8220;You expect fighting, then?&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure. You see how sharply we were
pursued in running in? Well, if they would
exert themselves so much against a single
schooner, it stands to reason that they will
double their efforts against a huge, helpless
fleet like this. The Chesapeake will see some
gunnery this morning, and before the sun
gets very high, in my opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your opinion&#8217;s a good one, my lad,&#8221;
said the gruff voice of Mr. Johnson, the
schooner&#8217;s mate, who was passing just then.
&#8220;There are some of the British lying outside
there, ready and waiting for this fleet of old
pine planks; and they&#8217;ll dance with delight
when we show ourselves in open water.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>There was a great flurry and noise in the
vast gathering of merchantmen; their capstans
clanked, their blocks and rigging
creaked, their seamen chanted as they hauled
upon the ropes. Then one after another they
got under way; the Defence and the Revenge,
followed by the other vessels carrying guns,
led, under easy sail; the fleet as it passed
down the bay and out into the Atlantic made
an imposing appearance.</p>

<p>The shore line had not yet been dipped
under the sparkling waters, when Mr. Johnson&#8217;s
prophecy came true. A fleet of privateers
suddenly hove in sight, close under the
land. The Revenge flew the signal for a
superior force, and ordered all unarmed vessels
to return to port, and the others to rally
about her. The Defence promptly bore up
in answer to the signal, but, to the shame of
the others, only one brig followed her example;
the rest ran for Hampton Roads.</p>

<p>The British fleet consisted of a large ship
of eighteen guns, a brig of sixteen and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
schooners; and with one accord they stood in
for the body of the merchantmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be a general capture if that is
allowed,&#8221; said the skipper of the Defence to
his mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; growled Mr. Johnson. &#8220;It&#8217;s
time for the Revenge to show her teeth, if
Murray expects to do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for the Defence, too,&#8221; said Captain
Deering. &#8220;Ready the Long Tom, Mr. Johnson;
we&#8217;ll try a round shot at that nearest
schooner; she&#8217;s too saucy by far for the weight
she carries.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long gun was charged and the captain
himself sighted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a long, slow swell,&#8221; said he to
Tom, &#8220;and that&#8217;s the best sort for gunnery
afloat. You can time the rise to a fraction of
a second. The best gunners are going to win
this fight, for everything is in their favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran his eye along the polished length
of the pivot gun, then applied the match.
Long Tom barked sharply, the solid shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
went skipping across the waves like a heavy-winged
bird; there came a quick crackling
sound upon the schooner fired into and her
foremast, splintered close to the deck, went,
in a tangle of rigging and spars, over the
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well aimed,&#8221; praised Mr. Johnson, admiringly.
&#8220;She&#8217;s out of the fight for awhile,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the Revenge,&#8221; cried Tom.</p>

<p>The letter of marque had put herself
into a tight place; in order to give his merchantmen
time to escape, Captain Murray had
awaited the approach of the privateers, and
in a short time he was between the fire of the
ship and brig. As Tom spoke the Revenge
let go both broadsides and she reeled trembling
under the shock. As Captain Deering
had predicted, good gunnery was going to be
felt in that long, slow swell; the firing of the
Revenge was almost perfect, and the damage
done by her broadsides and smaller guns
during the next half hour was very great.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_316.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">
<i>&#8220;WELL AIMED&#8221; PRAISED<br />
MR. JOHNSON</i></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>The two uninjured schooners bore up on
the Defence and engaged her; the American
brig here entered the fight, with the brass
carronades with which she was armed. She
took the attention of one of the schooners
from the Defence, and Captain Deering
headed for the other with his bow guns barking
like vicious dogs and the powder-smoke
almost covering his vessel&#8217;s advance. The
steering-gear of the privateer had been damaged
by a well-placed shot from the long gun
early in the action; so she could not man&#339;uvre
as she otherwise would have done;
the result was that the Defence laid herself
alongside, and with a wild cheer the seamen
and swamp-riders, led by Tom and the mate,
sprang over the rail and rushed among her
crew. These latter, apparently, were not accustomed
to this style of fighting, for after a
weak resistance they threw down their arms
and cried for quarter.</p>

<p>Captain Deering directed that they should
be driven down below and the hatches battened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
down; then placing a half dozen men
on board the captured craft to manage her, he
drew off. The American brig was still engaged
with the third schooner; the latter was
the lightest armed and manned, and as the
brig seemed fully capable of providing her
with entertainment the Defence went about
and bore up for the Revenge.</p>

<p>Captain Murray was fighting his vessel with
desperate resolution; but, by this time, his
ammunition began to grow low, for they had
been hotly engaged for a full hour, and his
fire had somewhat slackened. And now the
gallant officer&#8217;s heart leaped with delight as
he saw the Defence heading for the brig, upon
his starboard; for with the attention of this
vessel attracted from him for a space he felt
that he could deal with the ship.</p>

<p>Tom Deering, who had sailed upon many
coasting trips in the Defence before the outbreak
of the war, was at the helm; Captain
Deering was superintending the loading of his
guns with canister and musket balls; Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
Johnson was mustering a boarding crew in
the waist. As they neared the brig, which
greeted them with a scattering fire of small
arms and a broadside which did little or no
damage, the captain shouted to Tom,</p>

<p>&#8220;Down your helm&mdash;hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>The signal had been arranged between
them; the brig man&#339;uvred to meet the expected
movement of the schooner; but Tom
promptly threw his helm up, and a swinging
spar became entangled in the rigging of the
Defence, whose mate at once, with a body of
seamen, sprang to make the tangle secure.
The schooner was now in a position from
which she could rake the brig from stem to
stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire,&#8221; cried Uncle Dick. The guns,
loaded with the canister and musket balls,
swept the British ship&#8217;s decks, and in a few
moments there was not a man to be seen.
Those who had not fallen by the fire had
sought safety below decks; Mr. Johnson was
about to give the word to board, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
lashings gave way, and the two vessels drifted
apart.</p>

<p>The guns of the Defence were given time
to cool and commander and crew looked
about them. The ship which had engaged the
Revenge had hauled off; the third schooner,
after inflicting sufficient damage to the rigging
of the American brig to prevent pursuit,
had also drawn away. Then Captain Murray,
whose vessel had suffered severely, having
borne the pounding of both British ship and
brig for an hour, flew the signal to cease firing.
He knew that it would not be possible
for them to take the British vessels, so a continuation
of the action would only be a waste
of ammunition.</p>

<p>Within a half hour the enemy had drawn
together to make repairs; then they hoisted
what sail they could, and all five stood out
to sea, while the Revenge and Defence re-entered
the harbor with the crippled brig limping,
as it were, in their wake. For this gallant
action the skippers and crews received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
the thanks of the merchants of Baltimore.
The Defence was somewhat damaged by the
British fire; so Captain Deering delayed long
enough to refit; and there being no enemy
now to fear the merchant fleet sailed in safety
to their different destinations. One morning
the Defence also slipped out of the bay and
was soon bounding swiftly over the sparkling
waters of the Atlantic, on her way south.</p>

<small>HOW TOM DEERING SERVED WITH GENERAL
GREENE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> a week later the Defence ran into
Charleston harbor, and Tom Deering and his
friends, after bidding the skipper good-bye,
were put ashore. The journey back to the
district across the Santee was made on foot.
It was a long and wearisome one, and being
made at night caused it to seem all the more
difficult. The first day they passed at the Indian&#8217;s
Head; and in three nights more they
found themselves back in the camp of the
Americans.</p>

<p>It was shortly after their return that
Marion retired to Snow&#8217;s Island, which is to
this day pointed out as &#8220;the camp of the
Swamp-Fox.&#8221; He had concluded that the
place would be a safe depot for his arms, ammunition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
prisoners and invalids&mdash;difficult of
access, easily guarded and close to the scene
of his most active operations.</p>

<p>Snow&#8217;s Island lay at the confluence of
Lynch&#8217;s Creek and the Peedee. On the east
was the latter river; on the west was Clarke&#8217;s
Creek, issuing from Lynch&#8217;s, a deep stream
which small vessels might ascend; Lynch&#8217;s
Creek lay on the north, but was choked by
rafts, logs, and refuse timber. The island was
large; thick woods covered the elevated
tracts, dense cane-brakes the lower.</p>

<p>It was here that Marion made his fortress.
He secured all the boats in the neighborhood,
destroying those which he could not use.</p>

<p>Where the natural defenses of the place
seemed to require strengthening he labored
upon them; by cutting down bridges and
obstructing the ordinary pathways with timber
he contrived almost perfectly to isolate
the section of country under his command.
From this fortress his scouting parties were
sent forth nightly in all directions to report<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
on the doings of the British at Nelson&#8217;s
Ferry and Scott&#8217;s Lake.</p>

<p>Here Marion and his men lived like the
Robin Hood of old, and his generous outlaws
of Sherwood forest. Nature herself seemed
to be with them; the dense woods and interminable
growth screened them from the
enemy; the vine and briar guarded the
passes; the swamp was their moat; their bulwarks
were the deep ravines, which, watched
by sleepless riflemen, were quite as impregnable
as the castles of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Tom Deering and Cole were kept busy
those first days at Snow&#8217;s Island; for General
Greene, a soldier of great firmness, prudence
and forethought had some time before assumed
command of the army of the South,
and the young scout carried all the despatches
between the two camps. One day at the Continental
camp Tom was summoned to the tent
of the commanding officer. The sentry passed
him in, and he stood at the flap of the tent, his
hand at the salute, waiting to be addressed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>A number of officers were with General
Greene, and they seemed to be deeply interested
in some maps which lay upon the table
before them. General Greene at length
looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deering,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have sent for you
because you are well acquainted with this
country in every direction and because you
are very well spoken of by General Marion,&#8221;
for the American leader had now attained
that rank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, general,&#8221; answered Tom, wondering
what was to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have probably heard,&#8221; continued
the officer, &#8220;General Morgan is operating in
the western section of the state; it is positively
necessary that I, in person, reach his force
without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can guide you, general,&#8221; said Tom
promptly. &#8220;I have been over the ground
many times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Greene, briefly. &#8220;See
that your mount is rubbed down, fed and well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
rested; and get some sleep yourself. We
start in the morning at daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom saluted and left the tent to communicate
the intelligence to Cole. The General
Morgan of whom Greene had spoken was in
command of a corps of light infantry, of the
Maryland line, numbering over three hundred
men, two hundred Virginia militia, and
the cavalry force that had, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Washington, just beaten the British
at Clermont. Sumpter had been wounded in
the fight at Blackstock and was, as yet, unable
to leave his bed, so his force, also, joined
itself to Morgan&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Cornwallis had been on the point of advancing
into North Carolina; but being unwilling
to leave Morgan&#8217;s brigade in his rear,
he despatched Colonel Tarleton against him.
Morgan had, at first, retreated before the
superior numbers of the British; but being
closely pursued, he halted at a place called
the Cowpens, and arranged his men in the
order of battle. Tarleton&#8217;s headlong dragoons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
rushed upon him; the militia had given
way and the regular troops followed. Just
when it seemed that Morgan was beaten, he
succeeded in reforming his scattered ranks
and ordered a general charge. Shamed, and
eager to show their gallant leader that his
faith in them had not been misplaced, the
Americans dashed at the astounded enemy
and sent them flying in all directions.</p>

<p>Upon receiving intelligence of Tarleton&#8217;s
repulse, Cornwallis left the banks of the
Broad River, after destroying his heavy baggage,
and commenced one of his rapid
marches toward the fords of the Catawba,
hoping to reach there in time to intercept the
retreat of Morgan, who would, of course,
know that he would now be pursued by the
main body of the enemy.</p>

<p>This was the news which General Greene
had just received, and which made him so
anxious to go to Morgan and personally see
that no rash measures were attempted that
would endanger the brigade. He, with Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
Deering, Cole and a half dozen mounted infantry,
started next morning. After a hard
ride of almost two days they reached Morgan
where he had encamped upon the Catawba.
He had reached the fords about two hours
before Cornwallis; the camp-fires of the latter
could be seen across the river, for the British
general had put off the crossing until morning,
being sure that he would overtake his
adversary then.</p>

<p>But, as fate willed it, the Catawba rose rapidly
during the night; and, to Cornwallis&#8217;
consternation, was impassable for two days.</p>

<p>Greene now took command of Morgan&#8217;s division
in person; Tom was sent out with a
party to watch the movements of the enemy
who, as soon as they could cross the river,
were once more in hot pursuit. It was a race
for the Yadkin, now; the Americans were
weighted down with baggage and their progress
was slow; the British carried nothing,
practically, but their arms, and their march
was made at great speed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>The rear-guard of the patriots was about
crossing the Yadkin when the van of the
British came up. Greene had put Tom in
charge of a small party which was detailed to
protect some baggage wagons; the wagons got
stuck in the soft and badly cut ford and the
enemy galloped forward with cheers to cut
them off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand, men!&#8221; called Tom, calmly.
&#8220;Steady! Don&#8217;t give an inch! We&#8217;ll make
these fellows pay dearly for the baggage.
Hold your fire until I give the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he talked to them as they stood, waist
deep, in the stream; the British rode forward
firing their pieces and then plunged into
the ford. The rear-guard at the word from
Marion&#8217;s young scout raised their rifles and
poured a steady volley into them which emptied
many saddles. General Greene rode down
to the edge of the stream about this time.</p>

<p>Tom saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we cannot save the wagons,
general.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;Get more horses,&#8221; ordered Greene, who
disliked leaving behind supplies of which his
soldiers were so much in need.</p>

<p>Fresh horses were hitched to the wagons,
the teamsters cracked their whips and shouted
like madmen; but it was no use.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wheels are too deeply sunk in the
mud, general,&#8221; reported Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut the traces,&#8221; directed General Greene,
regretfully; &#8220;we must leave them, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the traces were being cut another
charge was made by the enemy&#8217;s horsemen.
The rear-guard under Tom had crossed the
ford, and met the charge with steady courage.
The deadly rifles spoke with flaming tongues,
and once more the dragoons fell back. This
time, however, they had approached nearer,
and as they were scattering to run Tom caught
sight of a face which caused him to start with
surprise and then clap spurs to Sultan in
reckless pursuit.</p>

<p>It was Mark Harwood, in a British uniform,
dismounted by the rifle fire and racing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
desperately to escape. But a dozen bounds
of the big chestnut placed Tom alongside his
enemy; with a drawn pistol held to his head
Mark paused, his face deathly white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Tom, have mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my prisoner,&#8221; said Tom, sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Mark. &#8220;Morgan or Greene
would hang me. Let me go. I&#8217;ll do whatever
you say. I&#8217;ll tell you where your father
is&mdash;I know you&#8217;ve been anxious about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; Tom&#8217;s heart beat hard.
Since the night of the battle in the bay he
had heard nothing of his father and had
spent many hours and days brooding upon
his fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise you&#8217;ll let me go free,&#8221; demanded
the Tory, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was taken on board the frigate Benbow,
which sailed for New York some time
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you speaking the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my honor.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>&#8220;Your honor!&#8221; Tom laughed with scorn.
&#8220;But go, I give you a minute to get out of
my sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark dashed for the bush and disappeared
like magic; Tom turned Sultan&#8217;s head and
rode back to his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were about to take a prisoner,&#8221;
said General Greene. &#8220;We cannot
bother with them now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a Tory cousin of mine, general,&#8221;
said the scout. &#8220;He gave me some valuable
information about the whereabouts of my
father, and, knowing that you wanted no
prisoners anyway, I let him go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right. I am glad to hear that
you&#8217;ve had news of your father. I have
heard how he was taken prisoner; he was a
brave man. Perhaps we can secure his exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we only could,&#8221; cried Tom, eagerly.
&#8220;I would give anything to see him at liberty
once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>And from that time on there was not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
hour that he was not planning a way by
which his father was to breathe free air again.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could only get to New York,&#8221; he repeated
constantly. &#8220;If I only could get to
New York. I might be able to do something,
then. But here I am helpless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some nights later the opposing armies were
once more encamped with only a stream between
them. And again, remarkable as it
seems, the water rose suddenly in the night,
making the ford impassable.</p>

<p>This afforded Greene time to put a goodly
distance between himself and Cornwallis; but
the latter continued the chase with unabated
determination, as soon as he had made the
crossing; Greene was retreating toward Virginia;
and having abandoned some of his
baggage was making better progress. Once
more they approached a river, this time the
Don; Greene&#8217;s army crossed it just as, for the
third time, the British reached the opposite
bank. Disheartened by these continued disappointments
after such desperate efforts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Cornwallis here gave up the chase, and
marching south, established himself at Hillsboro.</p>

<p>Greene lay on the Don for some little time,
resting the weary brigade and recruiting.</p>

<p>The defense of Virginia was at this time in
the competent hands of the Marquis de Lafayette
who was encamped not far from Petersburg.
Desiring to communicate with him
before marching back into Carolina, General
Greene one day sent for Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to give you a chance to set
your father free,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s eyes sparkled with joy; he could
scarcely hold himself in, so great was his
delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do that, general,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and there is
nothing that I will not do in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In giving you this opportunity,&#8221; said
Greene, &#8220;I am also sending you upon a dangerous
mission. I want you to carry some
important dispatches to General Washington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
who is somewhere in the neighborhood of
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221; Tom stood saluting in
the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;These papers contain the reports of the
army of the South, and are to be forwarded to
Congress. I tell you this in order that you
might know the value of your charge and
guard it accordingly. When you go out, tell
the sentry to request General Morgan to come
to me. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom saluted and left the tent. All that
day Greene and Morgan were in consultation;
the result was a goodly packet of papers
strongly tied and securely sealed, which were
handed Tom next day as he sat upon Sultan&#8217;s
back before the commander&#8217;s headquarters,
with his faithful Cole at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make your best speed,&#8221; said General
Greene, &#8220;and guard your dispatches with
your life. And now, God bless you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hands of the young swamp-rider and
his faithful servant went up in a smart salute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
Then they touched Sultan and Dando with
the spur and went dashing away toward the
north, Tom&#8217;s heart throbbing with joy at the
prospect of at last rendering his father aid.</p>

<small>HOW A TRAITOR TO HIS COUNTRY WAS TAKEN
AND LOST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hardships of the following weeks were
never forgotten by Tom Deering nor Cole;
the entire state of Virginia seemed overrun
with the enemy in small parties; they were
compelled to lie concealed for days at a time
in the hut of a slave, in the cabin of a woodman
or in the dwellings of patriots of higher
rank. Sometimes these shelters were not to
be had; and in such cases they slept in the
woods or the thickets. Food was scarce, and
many days they scarcely broke their fast.</p>

<p>At length joyous news reached them.
Lafayette had set out from Baltimore in the
latter part of April and had arrived on the
29th, after forced marches of two hundred
miles, at Richmond. This was the first news
of the gallant marquis that they had heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
since leaving the camp of General Greene on
the Don, weeks before. They were not more
than a hundred miles or so from Richmond
at the time, and at once set out for that place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great things have happened, Cole, since
we started on this journey,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;and
greater still are going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>News had reached them that on March
15th Greene, with an army of above 4,000
men had been attacked by Cornwallis at Guilford
Court House, and they learned that while
the Americans had fallen back, Cornwallis
was so badly crippled that he could not follow
up his advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they say,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;that Lord
Cornwallis intends to march north and endeavor
to conquer Virginia. Well, let him
come; I suppose Lafayette will be ready for
him, and perhaps he will find that Virginia
is as tough a bone to pick as Carolina.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were riding, while Tom spoke, along
a narrow and little frequented road; it was
late on the second day of their journey since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
hearing of the entrance of the French general
into Richmond, and they had already began
to wonder how far they were from the town.
Standing some distance from the road, among
a clump of trees was a long, low building that
looked like a schoolhouse. The two stopped
to examine it carefully before venturing into
full view of its possible occupants.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like a schoolhouse,&#8221; said the
young swamp-rider, &#8220;and, if it is, should be
deserted at this time. But there is no telling,
in these days, for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But he never finished the sentence.</p>

<p>A scream rang out from the building at
which they were gazing, and almost at the
same instant the door burst open and a boy
of possibly fifteen darted forth. After him
followed a man in the uniform of a British
general of brigade, and two soldiers, one of
whom carried a rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, you dog,&#8221; cried the officer in a high,
harsh tone. &#8220;Stop, or I fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>He held a heavy pistol in his hand; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
fleeing lad saw it and stopped, terror-stricken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back,&#8221; directed the officer, a sneer
curling his lip at the promptness of the obedience.
&#8220;Come back, you young hound, and
answer the questions which I ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy retraced his steps reluctantly. A
girl of about sixteen, meantime, had emerged
from the building with two small children
clinging to her skirts; fear had blanched all
their faces; they gazed, trembling and silent,
at the boy and the officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are needed here, Cole,&#8221; said Tom,
evenly. &#8220;I wonder how many there are in
the party at the schoolhouse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole bent his brows in an expression that
expressed his fear that there were more of
them than were visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay here,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Dismount
and have your rifle ready. I&#8217;m going over
there to speak to those redcoats.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole, without a word, did as commanded;
he squatted among some bushes in a spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
from which he had a clear view of the schoolhouse;
his rifle was held between his knees,
ready for anything that might occur.</p>

<p>The lad at the schoolhouse, white-faced and
with quivering lip, stood before the British officer;
he was a slight, delicate boy, at best, and
seemed unaccustomed to rough treatment.
The redcoat glared at him like an animal,
blood hungry and enraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want the truth,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you the truth,&#8221; was the boy&#8217;s
reply. &#8220;I know nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; Turning to the soldier who
held the rope, the officer proceeded, &#8220;Corporal,
bring the halter here; perhaps that
will bring him to his senses and induce him
to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl, who stood in the doorway with
the children, screamed sharply and, running
forward, she threw her arms about the boy&#8217;s
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t harm
him; he is my brother; he knows nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>&#8220;Corporal,&#8221; ordered the officer, &#8220;take her
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite her cries, the girl was dragged
away; the boy forgot his own danger and
sprang toward the two soldiers, his eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her go,&#8221; he cried, his pale cheeks
flushing with indignation. &#8220;Take your
hands off, you cowards!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you have spirit, have you,&#8221; cried the
officer, his laugh sounding harsh and unpleasant
upon the evening air. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll
need it before many minutes, my lad, if you
don&#8217;t loosen that tongue of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you again, I know nothing about
the American general&#8217;s army; I did not see
them; I do not know how many or how few
men there are in Richmond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Corporal, the halter,&#8221; cried the officer;
&#8220;there is no use in our wasting words here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The British corporal brought the rope; the
boy&#8217;s eyes widened as he looked upon it, but
his lips closed firmly. Without a word more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
it was tossed over the limb of a near-by tree
and the corporal was widening the noose
when Tom rode up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just one moment,&#8221; said Marion&#8217;s young
scout. &#8220;I would like to know what this little
pleasantry means, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat upon Sultan&#8217;s back and gazed coolly
into the faces of the three redcoats. The officer
had put down his pistol some few minutes
before, and now clapped his hand to his
sword. He was a handsome man, with piercing
eyes that contained, also, something that
was cold and cruel; his nose and chin were
prominent and aggressive, demonstrating a
bold and enterprising spirit&mdash;a spirit capable
of great things or the most base. He looked
at the young swamp-rider for a moment, and
then said, sneeringly,</p>

<p>&#8220;So you would like to know what this little
pleasantry, as you call it, means, would
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Tom Deering, his voice as
even as though he were talking to Cole by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
the camp-fire, and his eyes as steady as though
he were gazing at an empty horizon line, &#8220;I
have some curiosity on that point. If you
see your way clear to enlightening me I
should be obliged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, suppose,&#8221; said the British brigadier,
&#8220;suppose I should refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that event,&#8221; spoke the scout, &#8220;I would
venture a guess&mdash;and a pretty accurate one, I
fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; The bitterness of the officer&#8217;s
sneer increased. &#8220;You flatter yourself upon
your coolness, I take it; but this time, at
least, you have made a mistake.&#8221; His sword
suddenly flashed out from its scabbard, and
in a voice thick with rage, he shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;You rebel dog, I&#8217;ll teach you a lesson for
your insolence. Down from your horse!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_344.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">
<i>THE OFFICER SPRANG<br />
FORWARD</i></p>


<p>Tom sat still, gazing into the passion inflamed
countenance before him; seeing that
he did not move to obey, the officer sprang
forward, his sword ready for a blow. When
it descended Tom received it upon the steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
barrel of his holster pistol, not even troubling
himself to draw his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, gazing with irritating
calmness into the other&#8217;s eyes, &#8220;you really
should not allow yourself to give way to these
sudden fits. You are of a rather stout habit,
and apoplexy is not a thing to be tempted.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the brigadier seemed unable
to speak, so enraged was he. Then he managed
to shout an order to the corporal; and
the latter rushed toward his rifle which stood
leaning against the schoolhouse wall. But
his hands had no sooner closed upon it, than
a shot rang out from the bushes at the roadside
and he fell prone upon his face. At this
the other soldier sprang at the young man,
plucking a bayonet from his belt; but the
heavy ball of Tom&#8217;s pistol broke his shoulder
and he sank beside his comrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir,&#8221; said Tom sternly, &#8220;you are my
prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The British brigadier looked at him gloweringly
for a moment; his sword was held as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
though he meditated another spring, but Tom
checked any idea which he might have had
of such an attempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you desire to throw away your life,&#8221;
said the young scout, &#8220;attempt to escape. If
I raise my hand you will be shot from the
cover along the road just as your corporal
was.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a haggard, despairing look in the
British officer&#8217;s face as he, at length, laid
down his sword. Tom called Cole from his
post, and the giant negro mounted guard over
him. In a few moments Tom discovered that
the three redcoats had ridden up to the schoolhouse
just as the children were about leaving
it for the day. The boy whom they were
about to hang, young as he was, was the
schoolmaster; the girl and the two younger
children were his sister and brothers, who had
clung to him in his danger, even after all the
others had scattered, terror-stricken, to their
homes about the countryside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richmond,&#8221; said the young schoolmaster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
&#8220;is about three miles away, straight ahead.
Keep to the road; you can&#8217;t help but strike it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole bound the prisoner upon his horse,
which was found tied behind the schoolhouse;
the young girl and her brother
thanked them with tears in their eyes; and
then they mounted and rode away in the
direction indicated.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when they, at length,
sighted the lights of the town from a rise in
the ground; they skirted a clump of woods
and entered a lane which was lined with trees
upon each side and was very dark. However,
as it seemed to lead directly to Richmond,
they pushed ahead without any hesitation.
They had ridden well into the lane, when a
volley of shots rang out; Cole clutched at his
arm, and the prisoner&#8217;s horse fell kicking in
its death agonies.</p>

<p>Cole took his rein in his teeth and, following
Tom&#8217;s example, drew his pistol as
he set spurs to his horse. With great leaps
Sultan and Dando bounded forward and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
they sped down the dark lane they heard
their late prisoner&#8217;s voice crying after them,
triumphantly,</p>

<p>&#8220;When you reach De Lafayette, tell him
how you caught me, and how I slipped
through your fingers!&#8221;</p>

<p>Within an hour after escaping this ambush
Tom was in the camp of Marquis de Lafayette,
and was explaining his mission to that
brave gentleman himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is almost a miracle that you have
escaped capture,&#8221; said he, speaking with a
slight French accent. &#8220;Your ride from North
Carolina must have been filled with many
perils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, general,&#8221; answered the youth; &#8220;but
the strangest of all happened on the road just
below the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! and what was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very few words Tom told him of his
capture of the British brigadier, the ambush,
and the prisoner&#8217;s cry when he found himself
safe with his friends once more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>The general&#8217;s keen eyes flashed. &#8220;What
was he like&mdash;your prisoner?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Describe him!&#8221; and Tom began to tell what
he could remember. But almost at the first
word General de Lafayette came to his feet with
a spring, and his clinched fist struck the table
a blow that made it dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was he,&#8221; came from his lips in almost
a shout. &#8220;It was the arch-traitor Benedict
Arnold himself! He is here with Phillips,
and is leaving a trail of rapine behind him.&#8221;
The marquis clapped Tom on the back, as he
continued, regretfully: &#8220;My boy, you have
escaped fame by a hair&#8217;s breadth; by to-night&#8217;s
work on the road you came within the
wink of an eye of writing your name with
your sword-point upon the pages of your
country&#8217;s history!&#8221;</p>

<small>HOW TOM DEERING RODE WITH WASHINGTON
AT YORKTOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> remained with Lafayette in Virginia
for some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your orders,&#8221; the general had said to him,
&#8220;are to make all speed to General Washington&#8217;s
camp, are they not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, general,&#8221; answered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, you will make more speed by remaining
where you are for a time. To attempt
to win your way through the country
north of here would be folly at this time&mdash;you
would lose both your dispatches and your
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested Tom, &#8220;my orders were
such as to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your orders were to deliver the dispatches
to General Washington,&#8221; spoke Lafayette,
quietly. &#8220;And if you ride north now, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
be as though you desired the papers to fall
into the hands of the enemy.&#8221; He smiled at
the young scout&#8217;s indignant expression.
&#8220;You love your country&#8217;s cause, I feel sure
of that; but it is one thing to be brave and
another thing to be foolish. Wait; in a few
weeks, or days, perhaps, by hard riding and
great caution you might get through. But
at this time the attempt would be suicide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom realized the truth of all this, but
chafed at the delay; now that he had definite
news of his father he burned with the desire
to help him in some way.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could only put the matter before
General Washington,&#8221; he told himself again
and again, &#8220;he would have him exchanged,
for the general would appreciate his service.&#8221;</p>

<p>The friends of America in the British parliament,
and they were many, were rapidly
beginning to make headway at this time;
Lord North was put to his wit&#8217;s end to maintain
his position against them. &#8220;End the
war,&#8221; was beginning to be heard night after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
night in both the Commons and the Lords;
even the crusty old king was beginning to
waver in his purpose.</p>

<p>Colonel Phillips and the traitor Arnold had
been beaten off by Lafayette and the gallant
Baron Steuben; and just as Phillips was
breathing his last Cornwallis arrived in
Petersburg with 7,000 picked men. Cornwallis,
while a stern, relentless soldier&mdash;indeed a
ruthless, in many respects, was still a gentleman;
and one of his first acts upon taking
command, was to pack Arnold back to New
York; the traitor was more than he could
tolerate.</p>

<p>The British at once seized all the horses for
many miles around&mdash;hundreds of them&mdash;overran
the James River district, and took
possession of Richmond and Williamsburg.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing I like about the war as
conducted in Virginia,&#8221; Tom said to Cole one
morning as they were ready to depart on a
scout. &#8220;There are not nearly so many Tories;
there is not that neighbor against neighbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
which exists in Carolina. Up here almost
every enemy wears a red coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the day that Tom intercepted a
dispatch from Sir Henry Clinton, calling
Cornwallis to the seacoast. He reported in
the afternoon to the commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is the dispatch?&#8221; asked
Lafayette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Cornwallis has it by this time, I
suppose,&#8221; answered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Lafayette looked at his horseman
sharply. &#8220;Tell me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I and my servant, general, sprang upon
the courier just as he was climbing the bank
after crossing the James. We took his papers
and let him go. As you directed me to do in
every case, I read the dispatches in order to
assure myself that they were worth bringing
to your notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; said the general, expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Clinton desires Lord Cornwallis
to at once proceed to the coast, and hold himself
ready to reinforce the army at New York.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>&#8220;Ah, is Washington pressing Sir Henry so
close!&#8221; cried Lafayette, delighted. &#8220;If so I
see the end coming at last. But proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;During the morning,&#8221; continued Tom, &#8220;I
was sighted by a scouting party of the enemy.
I had sealed up the dispatches about as I got
them, and in my flight I managed to drop
them, as though by accident. This ruse, I
thought, would lead General Cornwallis to
think that the contents of the dispatches were
still secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good!&#8221; said the French general, his
lip closing in a firm line. &#8220;This perhaps
will lead to something.&#8221;</p>

<p>What it led to was this: Cornwallis, in
answer to Clinton&#8217;s appeal, set his force in
motion from Williamsburg to Portsmouth.
He was upon the point of crossing the James
when Lafayette attacked him with great fury,
under the impression that the main body of
his army had already crossed.</p>

<p>A day or so before, Tom had been despatched
in hot haste to the camp of General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
Wayne to urge him to form a junction with
Lafayette. At the prospect of a fight &#8220;Mad
Anthony&#8221; had leaped to his feet and roared
out his orders to make ready to break camp.
And, as it happened, it was he that led the
attack upon Cornwallis at the James. Tom,
who had a high admiration for the courage of
this dashing soldier, had asked leave to remain
with him during the fight, and had
granted the permission with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may want a fast horse to carry back my
news of victory,&#8221; said he, a twinkle in his
eye, &#8220;and,&#8221; with a glance of appreciation at
Sultan, &#8220;you have the best in the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was only a short time after this that
they threw themselves upon the enemy. General
Wayne&#8217;s eyes opened wide at sight of
their great array.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re attacking Cornwallis&#8217; entire force,&#8221;
cried a staff-officer in dismay. &#8220;Shall we
sound the retreat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wayne threw his eagle eye over the
field.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he shouted, hotly. &#8220;Sound the
charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bugle rang out and the slender command
charged with great impetuosity; then
like a flash, before the astounded British
could recover, Wayne ordered a retreat. If
he had attempted the retreat in the first instance
the chances are that he would have
lost his entire command; as it was, Cornwallis
was so astonished at the bold man&#339;uvre
that he could not take advantage
of the American&#8217;s position until too late.
Afterward he, apparently, suspected an ambuscade,
for he sternly forbade any pursuit.</p>

<p>The country to the north was now somewhat
clear of the enemy, and Tom asked General
Lafayette&#8217;s permission to go on toward New
York.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be as well, perhaps,&#8221; said the
French officer. &#8220;The way is as free of British
as it will be for some time, and the dispatches
are evidently important. But proceed by way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
of Baltimore; you have the best chance of
getting through by that route.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ride to Baltimore was a long and difficult
one, also attended by great danger.
When he reached that city he, of course, at
once proceeded to the home of his Uncle Ben.
After greeting Laura, who was delighted to
see him, he inquired after the brave old skipper
of the Defence&mdash;Uncle Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Defence is being used as a dispatch
boat by the Count de Grasse,&#8221; answered Uncle
Ben. &#8220;You know the French fleet is now in
the Chesapeake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;you astonish me. I
have heard nothing of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The news was slow in coming,&#8221; laughed
Uncle Ben, his face shining with delight.
&#8220;It must have been delayed somehow. And
have you not heard of Cornwallis&#8217; position?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is at Portsmouth, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he remained there but a short time.
He has concentrated his force upon the south
side of the York River&mdash;a place called Yorktown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
There are some British war-ships in
the river; but Admiral de Grasse has both it
and the James blockaded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what good will all this do?&#8221; protested
Tom. &#8220;The Marquis de Lafayette is not
strong enough to cope with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; cried Laura, who had been listening,
&#8220;General Washington is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Washington!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have missed all the news, my boy.
Why, Washington has turned his attention
from Sir Henry Clinton at New York and is
marching on Cornwallis at Yorktown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then to deliver my dispatches I must
turn back!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, with sinking
heart. &#8220;My father is a prisoner upon the Benbow
frigate at New York; and I had hoped to
have him exchanged when I got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Benbow!&#8221; Uncle Ben stared at him.
&#8220;Why, the Benbow is not at New York. She
is one of the vessels in York River.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure!&#8221; Tom grasped his arm
excitedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>&#8220;I am positive.&#8221; The old man took a
letter from the cupboard. &#8220;It&#8217;s from your
Uncle Dick,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and was sent up
by means of a trading craft which he boarded
down the bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom read the letter eagerly. The Benbow
was the vessel whose boats they had attacked
that night in Charleston harbor. Before proceeding
north she sailed, with several hundred
slaves taken from the plantations of
patriots in the Carolinas, for the West Indies,
to help replenish the coffers of the king by their
sale. This occupied some months, and on her
way from there to New York with her white
prisoners she was met by the Defence and three
French ships of war. A running fight lasting
several days was the result, and it ended at
length by the Englishman running into the
Chesapeake and up the York River where she,
together with the other British ships, was
prevented from coming out by the fleet of Admiral
de Grasse.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Benbow is blockaded in the York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
River!&#8221; Tom almost shouted the words.
&#8220;And my father is on board! I now have two
reasons to reach Yorktown in time; to see Washington
thrash Cornwallis, and set my father
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>No time was lost; and he at once set out
upon the return journey with Cole. Both
Sultan and Dando seemed to feel the impatience
of their masters, and the journey was
made at a remarkable pace; they scarcely
stopped to sleep at all, and were it not for
their faithful horses would not have once dismounted
on the way.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s wish was granted; they arrived before
any decisive steps were taken. On
August 23d, De Grasse had landed two thousand
French troops under St. Simon to reinforce
Lafayette. On September 30th, Washington
had reached Yorktown, after a long
series of rapid marches, and was at once joined
by Lafayette and St. Simon. A British fleet made
an attempt to ascend the York and relieve Cornwallis,
but was driven off by Admiral de Grasse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>Tom found that Washington had posted
the French in front, and on the right of
the besieged town, extending from the river
above to the morass in the centre, where
they were met by the Americans, who extended
to the river below. The young
swamp-rider had arrived on October 6th;
and for two days and nights he and Cole slept
almost without a break. It was on the evening
of the 8th that they first reported for
duty to Lafayette.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general is engaged,&#8221; said the sentry
at the door of the marquis&#8217;s quarters. &#8220;General
Washington is with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Washington! Tom had not, as
yet, laid eyes upon the great Virginian, so he
waited near by. As it happened, Lafayette
heard his voice at the door, and sent an officer
out to bid him enter. Tom obeyed with
a beating heart; the French officer stood by
the table in the centre of the room, and in the
background were grouped a number of distinguished
Americans and Frenchmen. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
was the figure at the table that took the young
scout&#8217;s attention; it was that of a large man
with a calm, noble face, and the air of one who
commanded by natural right. His hands
rested upon the table before him, and his
eyes were fixed upon a youth who stood opposite
him, under guard. Tom could not restrain
a cry of surprise at sight of him. The
youth was Mark Harwood!</p>

<p>At the cry Washington looked toward Tom,
inquiry in his quiet eyes. Lafayette stepped
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, general, but this is the youth
of whom I have already spoken to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221; Washington&#8217;s face lit up with
one of his rare smiles. &#8220;I am pleased to
meet so brave a soldier,&#8221; said he, addressing
Tom. &#8220;I have heard of your service with
Generals Marion and Greene; and also of
what you have done since you joined General
de Lafayette. Believe me, your country is
proud of such sons; and while she has such
she is unconquerable.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>The young man&#8217;s face burned with pleasure;
praise from Washington was praise indeed,
and as he noted the smiles of the officers
gathered about, he felt that they, too,
thought the same.</p>

<p>After a few moments, the commander-in-chief
turned to a captain who stood at Mark
Harwood&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Lacey,&#8221; said he, &#8220;take this man
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not use my information, then?&#8221;
cried young Harwood, his face going pale.
&#8220;It is accurate; it will be of great service to
you. I was trusted by Lord Cornwallis and
I can tell you his positions; I can tell you
how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough,&#8221; Washington waved his hand.
&#8220;Have you no shame&mdash;have you no manhood?
You were trusted by General Cornwallis,
and now that you fancy him on the
verge of defeat, you come to me and offer to
betray him. Captain Lacey, take him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Mark sprang toward the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
at which Washington sat. &#8220;I can prove to
you&mdash;to all here&mdash;that my information is
worth your while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never deal with traitors,&#8221; returned General
Washington, sternly.</p>

<p>Mark&#8217;s face grew even more white as he
saw the expression in the American general&#8217;s
eyes; in desperation he turned to Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom Deering, tell them who I am. You
know me; you know whether I have Cornwallis&#8217;
secrets or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>Washington looked with sudden surprise at
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know this person?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Tom flushed. &#8220;I answer with shame,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;he is my cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; cried Mark, &#8220;did I not say he
knew me. Ask him about my likelihood to
have valuable information; he can tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; broke in General de Lafayette,
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is my cousin,&#8221; repeated Tom, steadily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
&#8220;He is a Tory and was a companion of Clarage,
Fannin and Gainey in Carolina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Washington&#8217;s eyes flashed as he
listened. &#8220;So he was leagued with those ruffians!
Well, that he should now turn traitor
is no more than might have been expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What disposition shall we make of him,
general?&#8221; inquired Captain Lacey, his hand
on Mark Harwood&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive him back to the British lines,&#8221; said
Washington, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Mark, in sudden panic,
&#8220;not that! Why, they would have no mercy
upon me now; they would shoot me at
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him away,&#8221; said de Lafayette,
shortly.</p>

<p>Two stout infantrymen were summoned,
and they dragged the traitor to the door, despite
his struggles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t send me back to the British,&#8221;
shrieked he, mad with fear, &#8220;don&#8217;t send me
back to my death. See, upon my knees, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
beg of you. I will do anything&mdash;tell you
anything&mdash;and not ask a penny in payment;
only don&#8217;t send me back; don&#8217;t send me
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coward was dragged gasping, livid,
and screaming away. Tom heard afterward
that Mark had been driven back into Yorktown
by a half dozen French and American
soldiers who pricked him with the points of
their bayonets whenever he showed a disposition
to lag. What happened upon his arrival
there Tom never knew; at any rate that
was the last he ever saw of him.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day&mdash;the 9th
of October&mdash;the American batteries opened on
the town at a distance of some six hundred
yards; and so heavy was the fire that many
of the British guns were dismounted and
silenced. Shells and red hot balls reached
the enemy&#8217;s frigates in the harbor, several of
which were burned. By the evening of the
11th the Americans had advanced to within
three hundred yards of the British lines.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>On the 14th Tom Deering participated in an
attack upon a redoubt, on the left, and helped
to carry it by assault; almost at the same time
a party of gallant French troops carried another,
on the same side. These were included
in the works of the besiegers. Nearly a hundred
pieces of heavy ordnance were now
brought to bear upon the British works, and
with such effect that the fortifications were
beaten down and almost every gun rendered
useless.</p>

<p>Tarleton&#8217;s force was posted at Gloucester
Point, across the York River; and, hoping to
break through the detachment of French
which Washington had placed in the rear of
that place, Cornwallis attempted to cross and
join hands with him. But a violent storm
came up and scattered his boats after one division
had succeeded in making the crossing.
The result was that on the 19th a capitulation
was made, and 7,000 British troops were
surrendered to Washington.</p>

<p>Tom entered the captured town with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
victorious general and his officers. He stood
upon a broken quay, with Cole, looking about
at the wreck which the American gunnery
had made, a feeling of sadness mingling with
the joy of the triumph. Suddenly Cole&#8217;s
strange cry sounded, and gazing in the direction
which the giant&#8217;s finger pointed he saw
the Defence, like a great bird with snowy, outstretched
wings, come scudding up the river.
The schooner had hardly lowered her sails and
plunged her anchor into the waters when the
two, having pulled out in a bateau, were upon
her decks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keel haul me, Phil,&#8221; cried the voice of
Captain Deering, &#8220;it&#8217;s Tom. It&#8217;s Tom! Your
son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; cried the youth. &#8220;Father!
Where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had not caught sight of the man leaning
against the mizzen mast, but who now
turned and sprang toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, my boy,&#8221; it was his father&#8217;s voice,
the same old voice whose kind ring he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
heard for these long, long years. And in a
moment they were locked in each other&#8217;s
arms. After greetings, delighted exclamations
and hugs had been indulged in, the
planter explained his presence on the Defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Lord Cornwallis surrendered to
Washington the British ships struck their
colors to Admiral de Grasse. And as the
Benbow on which I was a prisoner happened
to be one of them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And as I,&#8221; interrupted Captain Deering,
&#8220;heard that she had prisoners aboard her, I
got the French admiral&#8217;s permission to search
her well, in the hope that what has happened
would happen.&#8221; He clapped the planter on
the back. &#8220;And here he is, Tom, back
again; a little pale and somewhat the worse
for wear, but not beyond mending by any
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>They spent several hours comparing notes
and relating their personal experiences. The
planter&#8217;s eyes glowed as Tom told some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
his adventures. He had not had the opportunity
to serve his country, but he felt that
his brave boy had done enough for both.</p>

<p>&#8220;The war will not last much longer,&#8221; said
Tom, at length. &#8220;This is a blow from which
the enemy can hardly recover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re right, lad,&#8221; spoke Captain
Deering; &#8220;the men who do the talking will
now take the place of those who do the fighting.
Peace is not far off.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were right; but peace did not come
immediately. Greene, Marion, Sumpter and
Pinckney were still to strike swift, crushing
blows in Carolina. Five days after the fall
of Yorktown, Sir Henry Clinton arrived in
the Chesapeake with 7,000 men; but, learning
that Cornwallis had surrendered, he hastily
retreated.</p>

<p>On November 30, 1782, preliminary
articles of peace were signed at Paris. Savannah
was evacuated by the British in July<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
of 1783; New York in November; but
Charleston did not see the last of the enemy
until December. Upon the 14th of that
month the American columns entered the
city, and those of the enemy retired to their
ships. Tom Deering, his father, Uncle Dick
and Cole were among the first to enter; and
they sped as fast as their horses could carry
them to the Deering place. The slaves received
them with joy, and soon everything
was placed in order.</p>

<p>Not long afterward Laura was brought back
by Uncle Dick in the Defence; and one of
the first things which Mr. Deering did, after
his four thousand pounds had been recovered
from the old well, was to see that the papers
declaring Cole a free man were made out.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Cole protested,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a free nigger,&#8221; signaled
he, complainingly, to Tom. &#8220;I want to live
here on this plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom patted the giant negro&#8217;s great shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be the most unhappy day of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
life, Cole, to see you leave the plantation,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But after what you have done, we
can&#8217;t hold you in slavery. You must be a
free man&mdash;as free, as completely at liberty as
our country.&#8221;</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
